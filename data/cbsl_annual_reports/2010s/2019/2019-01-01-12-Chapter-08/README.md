8.1 OverviewT

he financial sector continued to expand

moderately during the year without causing

any major macroprudential concerns, amidst

challenging market conditions both globally and

domestically. However, credit quality of the banking

sector and the Licensed Finance Companies

(LFCs) and Specialised Leasing Companies (SLCs)

sector deteriorated considerably during 2018 with

increased non-performing loans and advances

compared to 2017. The challenging global and

domestic market conditions, unfavourable weather

conditions in 2017 and slowdown of economic

activities in 2018 contributed significantly to the

deterioration of quality of credit. Further, overall

performance of LFCs and SLCs sector slowed

down significantly during 2018 due to low credit

growth, declining profitability and increasing

nonperforming loans. Unfavourable developments

in global and domestic markets are also reflected

in moderate growth recorded by other sub sectors

such as insurance and primary dealers and decline

in equity market activities.

The banking sector showed a moderate expansion

during the year while maintaining capital and

liquidity levels above the regulatory minimum

requirements. The growth of the asset base of

the banking sector was moderate during the first

half of the year but accelerated in the second

half due to high growth in credit. The expansion

in credit growth was broad-based with diversified

lending across major sectors of the economy. The

profitability of the banking sector, as reflected by

Return on Assets (ROA) ratio and Return on Equity

(ROE) ratio declined during the year mainly due to

the deterioration in assets quality, rise in operating

costs and increase in taxes. The Central Bank

continued to strengthen the soundness of the

banking sector by implementing prudential policy

measures and regulations including enforcement

of Basel III requirements and adoption of Sri Lanka

Accounting Standards 9 (SLFRS 9) during the year.

LFCs and SLCs sector recorded a moderate

expansion, with a slowdown in credit growth and

profitability and a decline in asset quality. The

slowdown in credit growth was mainly attributed

to the fiscal and macroprudential policy measures

taken by authorities to curtail import of motor

vehicles with certain exceptions. Quality of assets of

the LFCs and SLCs sector deteriorated as reflected

in the increase in Non-Performing Loans (NPL)

ratios mainly due to the unfavourable weather

conditions experienced in 2017. Profitability of the

sector during the period also slowed down with

increased funding cost and loan loss provisions.

With a view of safeguarding the financial system

stability, the Central Bank continued to take

appropriate prudential measures where necessary

to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory

framework of LFCs and SLCs and also to address

the issues relating to several weak finance

companies. The contractual savings institutions

sector dominated by the Employees’ Provident

Fund (EPF) and Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF),

other than the Approved Pension and Provident

Funds recorded a moderate expansion during the

year. The Insurance Sector and Primary Dealers

in government securities expanded moderately

during the year without causing major stability

concerns. Nevertheless, a notable contraction of

the Unit Trust sector was observed during the year.

Domestic money market experienced a persistent

liquidity shortage during the second half of the

year mainly due to foreign exchange related

transactions carried out by the Central Bank and

the imposition of margin requirement on Letters

of Credit on motor vehicle imports. Despite, the

reduction of the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR)

by 1.50 percentage points to 6.00 per cent, from

7.50 per cent, with effect from 16 November 2018,

with a view to easing the liquidity shortfall, the

domestic money market continued to experience

a significantly low level of liquidity at end 2018.

In response, the Central Bank further reduced the

SRR by 1.00 percentage points with effect from

01 March 2019. Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan rupee

depreciated significantly against the US dollar

during the year in the face of four consecutive

interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve Bank of

the USA and the high demand for foreign exchange

from importers and reversal of some portfolio

investments. The pressure on Sri Lankan rupee

was further aggravated by the negative sentiment

created through political instability that ensued

during the last quarter of the year, followed by the

International Monetary Fund (IMF) withholding the

sixth tranche of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF),

which was expected to be disbursed during the

year. The Central Bank intervened in the forex

market to curb the excessive volatility by supplying

US dollars 1,120 million on net basis during

the year. The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE)

recorded yet another year of poor performance

during the period due to adverse developments

in local and global economic environment. The

negative developments in the CSE were evident

by the significant decline in share prices, market

turnover, market capitalization and Price to Earning

(PE) ratios throughout the year. The operations

of the payments and settlement systems of the

country were well maintained during the year

without major concerns over safety of the payment

and settlement infrastructure, and catered to the

payment needs of the economy without any major

disruptions.

Going forward, operating conditions of the banking

industry in the medium term will be challenging

due to the transition to higher capital standards

under Basel III, adoption of the Sri Lanka Financial

Reporting Standard (SLFRS) 9. However, in the

long run, implementation of Basel III and SLFRS

9 will improve the resilience and stability of the

banking sector. Also, capital levels of the LFC

and SLC sector are expected to be strengthened

as a result of enhanced capital requirements.

Continuous strengthening of risk management

framework pertaining to financial institutions are

vital for improving resilience of the financial sector.

8.2 Performance of the Banking Sector

The banking sector expanded during

the year, whilst exhibiting resilience by

maintaining capital and liquidity well above the

regulatory minimum though both global and

local conditions were challenging. The banking

sector continued to dominate the financial sector,

accounting for about 62.4 per cent (excluding the

Central Bank) of the total assets of the financial

sector at end 2018. The growth of assets of the

banking sector, which moderated during the first

half of the year, picked up during the second half

and was driven mainly by growth in credit. Deposits

continued to be the dominant source of funding of

the banking sector, while the declining trend in

borrowings, as a source of funds, reversed during

the year. The profitability of the banking sector

declined compared to the previous year, as a result

of deterioration in asset quality, rise in operating

costs and increase in taxes.

Business Expansion

(a) Outreach: At end 2018, the banking

sector comprised 33 banks, of which 26

were Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs)

and 7 were Licensed Specialised Banks

(LSBs). Of the 26 LCBs, 13 were foreign bank

branches. The banking sector continued to

support economic growth and development by

enhancing banking services and expanding the

banking network, thereby promoting financial

inclusion in the country. In 2018, several banks

introduced technology based products/services

to facilitate financial inclusion. Further, 34 new

bank branches and 801 new Automated Teller

Machines (ATMs) were established, raising the

number of banking outlets to 6,881 and ATMs to

5,031 at end 2018.

(b) Assets: The asset base of the banking

sector expanded by Rs. 1.5 trillion during

the year surpassing Rs. 11 trillion at end

2018. The asset base grew by 14.6 per cent

in 2018 compared to the 13.8 per cent growth

reported in 2017. During the second half of

2018 the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by

16.4 per cent against the US dollar, which

resulted in an increase in the growth of assets

and liabilities denominated in foreign currency.

The loans and advances increased by Rs.1.3

trillion during the second half of 2018. The

increase in loans accounted for 84.1 per cent

of the assets growth during 2018, with the

growth in loans increasing from 16.1 per cent

in 2017 to 19.6 per cent in 2018. About 72 per

cent of the increase in the loan portfolio of the

banking sector was attributed to the increase

in rupee loans. The increase in lending was

largely diversified across the major sectors of the

economy. In terms of products, credit cards (24.3

per cent), overdrafts (23.7 per cent) and term loans

(19.9 per cent) were the main products which

reported high growth rates during 2018. However,

the share of credit cards out of total loans was

minimal at 1.2 per cent. Meanwhile, year-on-year

growth in investments declined considerably from

12.5 per cent at end 2017 to 4.6 per cent at end 2018.

The investments in the trading portfolio contracted

by 4 per cent during 2018 with the investments in

Treasury bills and Sri Lanka Development Bonds

(SLDBs) decreasing by Rs. 47.9 billion and Rs. 2.3

billion, respectively, while investment in Treasury

bonds increased by Rs. 18.9 billion. However,

the Held-to-Maturity (HTM) portfolio grew by

7.5 per cent during 2018 with increases in Treasury

bills, Treasury bonds and SLDBs by Rs. 89.4 billion,

Rs. 35.2 billion and Rs. 26.3 billion, respectively.

(c) Liabilities: Deposits continued to be the

main source of funding representing 72 per cent

of total liabilities of the banking sector at end

2018, while borrowings accounted for 15 per cent.

The deposit base of the banking sector increased

by Rs. 1.1 trillion during the year reaching Rs. 8.5

trillion at end 2018. Year-on-year growth in

deposits declined to 14.8 per cent at end 2018 from

17.5 per cent at end 2017. Growth in time deposits

accounted for 78.7 per cent of the increase in

total deposits during the year, while savings and

demand deposits accounted for 12.7 per cent and

4.4 per cent, respectively, at end 2018. As a result,

the share of time deposits in total deposits had

increased to 65.5 per cent at end 2018 compared to

63.6 per cent at end 2017, while causing for Current

and Savings Account to total deposits (CASA) ratio

to decrease from 34.2 per cent to 32 per cent over

the corresponding period. Total borrowings of the

banking sector increased significantly by Rs.156.3

billion (9.7 per cent) in 2018 compared to the decline

of Rs. 89.3 billion (negative growth of 5.3 per cent)

in 2017. This increase was mainly due to increased

rupee borrowings which grew by 23.7 per cent

(Rs. 142.3 billion) in 2018. The increase in rupee

borrowing accounted for 91 per cent of the total

increase in banking sector borrowings. Meanwhile,

foreign currency borrowings in terms of Sri Lankan

rupees grew marginally by 1.4 per cent (Rs. 14

billion) mainly due to the depreciation of the Sri

Lankan rupee during the year.

(d) Off-balance sheet exposure: Off-balance

sheet exposures grew significantly by 14.7 per

cent (Rs. 569.4 billion) during 2018 compared

to the growth of 5.3 per cent (Rs. 194.6 billion)

during 2017. Undrawn credit lines accounted for

the largest share of off-balance sheet exposures

with a share of 27.8 per cent at end 2018.

Foreign exchange (FX) exposures accounted

for 32.5 per cent of the total off-balance sheet

exposure and was caused mainly by unsettled

FX purchases (16.8 per cent) and FX sales

(15.7 per cent). During 2018, foreign currency

exposures (39.2 per cent), undrawn credit lines

(22.1 per cent), acceptances (19.3 per cent) and

guarantees and bonds (16.3 per cent) contributed to the increase in total off-balance sheet exposures, while derivatives were the only off-balance sheet item to report a marginal decrease of 2.3 per cent (Rs. 13.1 billion).

Risks in the Banking Sector

(a) Credit Risk: Risk weighted assets considered for credit risk in the capital adequacy computation increased during the year due to the expansion of loan portfolios. Quality of credit of the banking sector deteriorated considerably during 2018 with non-performing loans (NPLs) increasing by Rs. 102.5 billion compared to the increase of Rs. 18.3 billion during 2017. The challenging global and domestic market conditions that prevailed in 2018 may have contributed to the deterioration of quality of credit. Consequently, the gross NPL ratio increased from a historically low figure of 2.5 per cent at end 2017 to 3.4 per cent at end 2018. Total loan loss provisions increased by Rs. 38.9 billion during 2018, out of which specific provisions accounted for 86.8 per cent of the increase. However, the higher increase in NPLs had resulted in a decline in specific and total provision coverage ratios from 49.6 per cent and 69.9 per cent at end 2017 to 43.1 per cent and 57.4 per cent at end 2018, respectively. Despite the increase in the NPL ratio during 2018, it is still at a manageable level compared to the levels

observed during 2013 that exceeded 5 per cent. Further, the banking sector operated with healthy levels of provisions and capital buffers to absorb any adverse impact.

Even though 75.7 per cent of credit was

concentrated on six economic sectors, the

exposure of individual banks to various

sectors of the economy, was rather diverse. The credit portfolio consisted of loans for consumption (18.1 per cent), construction (15.8 per cent),

wholesale and retail trade (15 per cent), manufacturing (10.5 per cent), infrastructure developments (8.2 per cent) and agriculture,

forestry and fishing (8.1 per cent) sectors.

(b) Market Risk:

Interest Rates: The interest rate sensitivity

ratio (interest bearing assets as a share of

interest bearing liabilities with maturities of

less than 12 months) had marginally increased

to 77.5 per cent at end 2018 from 76.5 per cent

at end 2017. Capital gains on Treasury bonds

during 2018 stood at Rs. 1.9 billion and was lower

than Rs. 4.8 billion reported during 2017. This was

due to the increase in market interest rates during

2018.

Equity prices: Equity risk of the banking

sector was minimal due to low exposure to

equity markets. Exposure to the equity market of

banks’ trading portfolio was Rs. 16.8 billion and was

only 0.1 per cent and 2.7 per cent, respectively, of

total assets and investments held for trading of the

banking sector at end 2018.

Exchange Rates: The net foreign currency

exposure of the banking sector had decreased at

end 2018 compared to end 2017, with the higher

increase in liabilities denominated in foreign

currency, compared to the increase in assets

denominated in foreign currency. During 2018, on-balance sheet assets denominated in foreign currency increased mainly due to the increase in placements with banks and investments, while off-balance sheet foreign currency liabilities increased mainly due to forward sales and other off-balance sheet liabilities. The net foreign currency exposure as a percentage of banks' on-balance sheet foreign currency assets stood at 0.8 per cent at end 2018. The banking sector reported a long foreign currency position of Rs. 11.7

billion at end 2018 in comparison to a long position

of Rs. 19.9 billion at end 2017. The banking sector

reported a net foreign currency revaluation gain of

Rs. 31.8 billion during 2018 compared to Rs. 8.6

billion during 2017 resulting from the depreciation

of Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar by

16.4 per cent during 2018 compared to the

depreciation of 2 per cent during 2017.

(c) Liquidity Risk: Despite the growth in

credit during 2018, the banking sector operated

with an adequate level of liquidity. The Domestic

Banking Units (DBU) of LCBs and LSBs are required

to maintain a minimum Statutory Liquid Asset

Ratio (SLAR) of 20 per cent. SLAR is calculated

as the ratio of approved liquid assets over total

deposits and borrowings for LCBs and the ratio

of approved liquid assets over total deposits

in the case of LSBs. The SLAR of domestic

banking units decreased from 31.3 per cent

at end 2017 to 27.6 per cent at end 2018 but

remained well above the regulatory minimum of

20 per cent, while the SLAR of off-shore banking

units increased from 35.5 per cent at end 2017 to

45.4 per cent at end 2018. Further, the expansion

of credit during 2018 had resulted in an increase in

the credit to deposits and borrowings ratio by 361

basis points, while liquid assets to total assets and

liquid assets to deposits ratios had declined by 304

basis points and 429 basis points, respectively.

The Rupee and All Currency Liquidity

Coverage Ratios of the banking industry stood

at 176.5 per cent and 152.1 per cent, respectively,

at end 2018, well above the regulatory minimum

of 90 per cent. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR),

which banks are required to maintain, is the stock

of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets that

can be converted easily and immediately into cash

in the secondary market to meet a bank’s liquidity

needs for a period of 30 days under a liquidity

stress scenario. Total liquid assets increased

only by Rs. 73.3 billion during 2018 compared to

Rs. 496.8 billion during 2017, due to the higher

growth in credit during 2018 compared to 2017.

Total liquid assets amounted to Rs. 3,035.9 billion

at end 2018, of which investments in government

securities represented 71.5 per cent. In addition

to the LCR, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)

which is expected to be implemented in 2019,

under which banks need to maintain sufficient

stable funding sources, the liquidity risk profile of

banks will be further strengthened.

The cumulative maturity gap as a percentage

of cumulative liabilities of the banking sector

for maturity buckets over 30 days and upto

less than 3 years narrowed marginally at end

2018 compared to end 2017 indicating better

management of assets and liabilities in the

medium term. Banking sector exposure to liquidity

risk is considered minimal due to maintenance of

adequate liquidity buffers.

Resources

(a) Profitability: Interest income of the banking sector grew at a higher rate (14 per cent)

compared to interest expenses (12.8 per cent)

during 2018, resulting in the net interest

margin of the banking sector increasing from

3.5 per cent in 2017 to 3.6 per cent in 2018.

Net interest income increased by Rs. 55.7 billion

during 2018 compared to the previous year, while

non-interest income increased by Rs. 25.7 billion

largely owing to revaluation of foreign currency.

However, the increase in non-interest expenses

by Rs. 49.6 billion, largely owing to the increase

in staff cost by Rs. 18.3 billion together with the

increase in loan loss provisions by Rs. 21.1 billion,

had resulted in lower profit before corporate tax of

Rs. 194.7 billion in 2018 compared to the previous year.

Profit after taxes of the banking industry

was Rs. 125.9 billion during 2018 and had

contracted by 9.1 per cent compared to the

previous year due to increase in provisioning,

staff cost and higher taxation of the banking

industry. The ROA declined from 2 per cent

in 2017 to 1.8 per cent in 2018, while the ROE

declined from 17.6 per cent to 13.2 per cent over

the same period. The efficiency ratio deteriorated

from 45.7 per cent in 2017 to 50 per cent in 2018,

due to the increase in operating costs.

(b) Capital: All banks were in compliance

with the Basel III capital requirements. Risk

weighted assets of the whole banking sector

grew by 20.4 per cent during 2018 largely due

to the increased credit growth during the year.

As a result, the core capital ratio and the total

capital ratio of the banking sector had marginally

declined from 12.4 per cent and 15.2 per cent,

Supervisory and Regulatory Developments

The Central Bank introduced a number of

prudential policy measures and regulations to

further strengthen the safety and soundness

of the banking sector during 2018. Licensed

banks were informed to refrain from the issuance

of Usance Letters of Credit for importation of motor

vehicles commencing from 01 January 2018, as

proposed under the National Budget for 2018, and

decided by the Parliament.

Banking Act Directions were issued to all

licensed banks informing Loan to Value (LTV)

ratios commencing from 01 January 2018,

when granting credit facilities (which includes

finance leases, hire purchase facilities and

all other facilities) for purchase or utilisation

of electric, hybrid and other registered and

unregistered vehicles. However, LTV ratios were

not applicable for credit facilities granted for any

company engaged in tourism and/or transportation

for purchase of vehicle fleets to be utilised for

their core business operations, provided that such

vehicles are not transferred to any person or entity

within one year from the date of the first registration,

and for credit facilities granted for procurement of

vehicles for government agencies under the finance

leasing method specified by the Ministry of Finance

and Mass Media. Further, LTV ratios were not

applicable for credit facilities granted for purchase

of motorcycles by field officers in the public service

and teachers serving in difficult areas under the

proposed concessionary leasing facility provided by

the government. Licensed banks were requested

to maintain internal limits and adopt adequate

risk management procedures for granting credit

facilities to such exempted categories. A Direction

was issued to licensed banks on measures to curtail

import of motor vehicles. Accordingly, LTV ratio for

credit facilities granted for the purpose of purchasing

respectively, at end 2017 to 12 per cent and

15.1 per cent, respectively, at end 2018. Enhanced

minimum capital requirements which banks need to

comply with by end 2020, the first day impact from

implementation of SLFRS 9 which is considered

for capital on a staggered basis over a period of

4 years and the Basel III capital requirements had

encouraged banks to raise high quality capital. The

regulatory capital of the banking sector reported a

growth of 19.3 per cent during the year, of which

Tier I capital contributed to 71.6 per cent. The

regulatory capital base of the banking industry

amounted to Rs. 1,038.2 billion at end 2018, of

which Tier I capital represented 79.6 per cent.

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

1. Background

The banking sector in Sri Lanka constitutes 33 banks and maintains assets totaling Rs. 11.8 trillion as at end 2018. The financial system is dominated by the banking sector accounting for nearly 60 per cent of the total assets of the financial system. At present, the banking sector is mainly funded by deposits accounting for more than 70 per cent of the total assets, whilst shareholders contribute to approximately 8.7 per cent of total assets. Presently, four banks of Sri Lanka are ranked among the top 1000 banks in the world, according to the Banker Magazine, UK.

Considering the important role played by the banking sector in the financial system and the economy of the country, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) continues to introduce prudential policy measures and regulations based on internationally adopted regulations and best practices, to further strengthen the stability and sustainability of the banking sector, as any stress in the banking sector can adversely impact the economy.

2. Enhance the Stability of the Banking System

2.1 Completion of Basel III Framework

In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) further strengthened the capital and liquidity requirements under the Basel III framework in order to address a number of shortcomings in the pre-crisis regulatory framework and to provide a foundation for a resilient banking system that will help avoid the build-up of systemic vulnerabilities.

2.1.1 Enhancing Capital Standards

Basel introduced two main capital standards viz., risk-based Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)1 and non-risk based Leverage Ratio2.

The Basel III capital standards endeavor to improve the quality and quantity of capital of banks by placing a greater focus on going-concern loss-absorbing capital in the form of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital when computing minimum CAR. Introducing capital buffers such as capital conservation buffer (CCB), countercyclical capital buffer and capital buffer for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs),

1 CAR=Total Regulatory Capital as a % of Total Risk Weighted Assets

2 Leverage Ratio=Capital Measure as a % of Exposure Measure

BOX 10Stability and Sustainability of Banks by Strengthening the Regulatory Framework

in addition to the higher minimum CAR ensures that banks are sufficiently resilient to withstand losses in times of stress.

One of the underlying causes of the global financial crisis was the build-up of excessive on and off-balance sheet leverage in the banking system. The Leverage Ratio under Basel III is a simple, transparent, non-risk based supplementary measure to the risk-based capital requirement. The Leverage Ratio will restrict banks to use excessive debt for financing its assets where higher leverage ratio reflects banks’ ability to withstand against adverse shocks to its balance sheet.

2.1.2 Liquidity Standards

The deficiencies in liquidity risk management of banks revealed during the global financial crisis led BCBS to reinforce global principles and standards for the measurement and management of liquidity risks in banks. The Basel III liquidity framework is centred on two standards; namely the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)3 and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)4 which were developed to serve two separate but complimentary objectives.

The objective of LCR is to promote the short-term resilience of a bank’s liquidity risk profile by ensuring that a bank has an adequate stock of unencumbered high quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can be readily converted to cash within the next 30 days, whereas NSFR promotes resilience over long-term time horizons by creating more incentives for banks to fund their activities with more stable sources on an ongoing basis. NSFR is intended to complement LCR by creating incentives for structural changes to bank funding profiles over a longer time horizon, thereby promoting a structurally sound banking system. Therefore, NSFR aims to reduce undue reliance on wholesale short-term funding and to encourage better liquidity risk management of banks.

2.1.3 Implementation of Basel III in Sri Lanka

CBSL has issued Banking Act Directions covering the above mentioned capital and liquidity standards under the Basel III framework to licensed banks in Sri Lanka and closely monitors their compliance in this regard.

Alignment to international regulatory standards such as the Basel III framework will be beneficial to banks not only in terms of improving capital adequacy, leverage and liquidity as stated above, but may also help banks in obtaining better credit ratings, which will be advantageous in sourcing funds from international markets and in maintaining correspondent banking relationships.

2.2 Strengthening Corporate Governance Framework

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines corporate governance as a set of relationships between a company’s management, its Board, its shareholders and other stakeholders, which provides the structure through which the objectives of the company are set, and the means of attaining those objectives and monitoring performance. It helps define the way authority and responsibility are allocated and how corporate decisions are made.

The objective of a corporate governance framework in banks is to help achieve robust and transparent risk management and effective decision-making, while ensuring responsibility and accountability of the Board of Directors and management and, in doing so, promote public confidence and uphold the safety and soundness of the banking system.

CBSL has issued Directions on corporate governance that comprehensively cover responsibilities of the Board of Directors of a bank, the Board's composition, criteria to assess the fitness and propriety of Directors, management functions delegated by the Board, the role and responsibilities of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of a bank, duties and functions of the Board appointed committees and related party transactions and disclosures. CBSL strictly monitors the adherence of banks with these Directions in an effort to strengthen the corporate governance culture of banks. In addition, the existing

framework on the assessment of fitness and propriety under corporate governance for banks will be further strengthened with robust assessment criteria and measures such as cooling-off periods.

To strengthen corporate governance and to avoid ownership concentration, dominance in the banks’ Boards, conflict of interest and risks in relation to related party transactions, share ownership in banks need to be broad-based. Therefore, the existing requirements on share ownership will be reviewed and a policy encouraging shareholders of international repute and diverse skills in the banking sector to hold shares in banks will be promoted.

2.3 Aligning to International Accounting Standards

With the implementation of Sri Lanka Accounting Standard – SLFRS 9: Financial Instruments, financial reporting of financial assets and liabilities of all entities for annual periods beginning or after 01 January 2018, is in line with the new Accounting Standard. Accordingly, licensed banks are required to provide for loan losses under the expected credit loss approach instead of the previous incurred loan loss approach. CBSL promotes consistent and prudent application of SLFRS 9 in the banking sector and has issued guidelines to licensed banks on the adoption of SLFRS 9. The adoption of SLFRS 9 will have a significant impact on banks and in order to avoid stress on capital and in line with the guidance given by BCBS, licensed banks were permitted to stagger audited first day impact on CAR under Basel III throughout a transitional period of four years.

2.4 Regulations on Market Conduct and Treasury Operations

There have been numerous instances in the banking industry across the globe where unethical and weak practices with respect to market conduct and treasury operations of banks have resulted in negative financial impact to customers and damages to the integrity of the market. This has resulted in banks facing enhanced regulation, substantial penalties and remediation costs as well as causing significant loss of trust amongst depositors and the public. Therefore, CBSL is continuously monitoring market conduct and treasury operations of banks and is in the process of reviewing the regulatory framework in this regard.

2.5 Technology Risks, Cloud Computing and Cyber Security

Digital transformation in the banking industry through developments in financial technology such as cloud computing, distributed ledger technology, artificial

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

261

8

intelligence etc., have paved the way for creating new products and services, increasing access to customers, strengthening bank controls and lowering costs. However, new technologies generate new risks, and recent high-profile cyber-attacks on financial institutions have also focused attention on the need to strengthen cyber security as banks are very vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Therefore, CBSL, as the regulator, is committed to achieving a balance between regulation, innovation and digital transformation, whilst taking measures to minimize technological risks.

Accordingly, CBSL issued a Road Map to licensed banks to improve technological risk resilience with a timeline for implementation from 2018 to 2020. Banking Act Directions in this regard, covering areas such as; information security governance, information security training and awareness for Board of Directors and staff of banks, implementation of an industry standard user access and identity management system, data classification based on information security sensitivity and data encryption, establishment of Security Operation Centers (SOC) for banks (i.e., particularly for D-SIBs), information security testing, system availability, staff competency requirements, compliance with international standards and requirements on different types of information system infrastructure ownership, management and location, will also be issued in due course to complement the Road Map.

2.6 Macroprudential Measures

Macroprudential policy measures and tools are primarily used to deal with systemic risks in the financial system as a whole considering inter-linkages between the financial sector and the real sector as opposed to just focusing on individual financial institutions. The following macroprudential regulatory measures introduced by CBSL are currently in place for the banking sector.

• Loan-to-value ratios (LTV)1 have been introduced to curtail credit granted, with respect to purchase/utilization of motor vehicles.

• Banking Act Directions issued on foreign currency borrowings of licensed banks provide a framework for short-term and long-term limits on foreign currency borrowings of banks. The limits on foreign currency borrowings are based on a score calculated considering the bank’s external long-term credit rating and CAR, and is computed as a percentage of total assets.

• Macroprudential regulatory measures on capital and liquidity implemented under Basel III framework are as follows:

1 LTV sets the maximum percentage of a loan that can be granted with respect to the market value of an asset.

o Capital buffer for D-SIBs to counter systemic risk.

o Imposition of capital conservation buffer (CCB), which is required to be built during good times and to be drawn down in a stressed situation.

o Minimum non-risk based Leverage Ratio as a macroprudential tool to restrict funding sources.

o Imposition of LCR and NSFR as counter-cyclical liquidity measures.

2.7 Facilitating Alternative Channels to Deliver Banking Services

Considering the high costs of maintaining brick and mortar structures to facilitate banking services, technological innovations and shift in consumer preferences, banks have moved towards alternate delivery channels, in order to expand the reach of banking services beyond traditional delivery channels while enhancing convenience to customers. This has led to a paradigm shift in the banking sector with banks expressing interest to venture into agent banking business through partnerships with entities such as fintechs, telecommunication companies and other retailers.

CBSL has issued Directions on a regulatory framework to oversee agent banking business in order to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial system whilst protecting customers. The Directions set out the permitted agent banking business and the requirements to be met by licensed banks in terms of risk management, selection of agents including sub-agents, consumer protection, complaint measures and relief mechanisms.

2.8 Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) and other Inter Regulatory Initiatives

Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision issued by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) strengthen supervisory and regulatory frameworks of banks’ risk management and set the minimum standards for prudential regulation and supervision of banks. Accordingly, Basel Core Principle 3 on ‘cooperation and collaboration’ and Core Principle 13 on ‘home-host relationships’, highlight the need to have in place a framework for co-operation and collaboration with relevant domestic authorities and foreign supervisors, whilst reflecting the need to protect confidentiality of information.

Therefore, considering the internationalization of the Sri Lankan banking sector and its cross-border presence, CBSL has initiated action to enter into MoUs with other supervisory authorities in the Asian region to exchange information as well as supervisory cooperation. At present, CBSL has entered into MoUs

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

2628

with the State Bank of Pakistan, the Reserve Bank of India and the Bangladesh Bank on cross-border supervisory cooperation and information sharing among regulators. Further, CBSL has also entered into MoUs for exchange of information with domestic regulators viz., Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) and the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (IRCSL).

2.9 Way Forward

2.9.1 New Banking Act

The banking sector is fast evolving and is becoming increasingly complex. Considering that the banking sector dominates the financial sector, and that certain banks are systemically important, strengthening the regulatory framework pertaining to licensed banks is important to maintain a dynamic and resilient banking sector that supports sustainable economic growth. Therefore, CBSL has initiated drafting a new Banking Act with a view to further strengthening the supervision and regulation of licensed banks. The key areas to be factored in to the proposed new Act include an overall mandate for supervision and regulation, strengthening corporate governance, digital banking, consolidated supervision, resolution, imposing monetary penalties/fines, ring-fencing to mitigate contagion risk, strengthening provisions for mergers, acquisitions and consolidation, subsidiarisation of large foreign banks and differentiated regulatory framework for banks.

2.9.2 Determining D-SIBs

The Financial Stability Board (FSB) states that Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) are institutions whose disorderly failure, due to their size, complexity and systemic interconnectedness, would cause significant disruption to the wider financial system and economic activity. In October 2012, BCBS finalised its framework for dealing with D-SIBs and this framework involves a set of principles on the assessment methodology and the higher loss absorbency (HLA) requirement for banks identified as D-SIBs.

At present, in Sri Lanka, D-SIBs are identified as banks with assets of Rs. 500 bn or above and apply a capital surcharge of 1.5 per cent commencing January 2019 on computation of CAR. Considering the importance and impact of D-SIBs to the banking sector and the economy, CBSL intends to formulate a comprehensive framework for determination of D-SIBs, in accordance with the principle-based framework issued by BCBS.

2.9.3 Subsisdiarisation of Large Foreign Banks

At present, certain foreign banks operate in a large scale in the local market similar to mid-sized domestic banks. Therefore, in the medium-term, large foreign

banks currently operating as branches would be required to convert to wholly owned subsidiaries of the respective foreign bank, if such banks are deemed as systemically important. The proposed framework of CBSL will require such banks to create separate legal entities, requiring these banks to have their own capital base, local Board of Directors and to clearly demarcate assets and liabilities of the domestic bank from that of its parent bank. Further, amendments will also be brought into the new Banking Act to facilitate the subsidiarisation of large foreign banks.

2.9.4 Consolidated Supervision

The global financial crisis highlighted the significant role that financial groups, including financial conglomerates play in the stability of global and local economies. Therefore, there is a need to supervise banking groups on an individual as well as on a consolidated basis, considering the need to protect banks from contagion risk, and to ensure the stability and the soundness of the banking sector and the financial system. Thus, the supervisor should have powers to carry out consolidated supervision of licensed banks, including powers to examine holding companies, subsidiaries and other affiliates of licensed banks and have full access to banking groups. In order to facilitate this process, CBSL intends bringing in provisions that will enable consolidated supervision of banking groups in to the new Banking Act, as well as formulating a regulatory framework on consolidated supervision. Further, in order to strengthen inter-regulatory cooperation and collaboration in this regard, CBSL, SEC and IRCSL entered into a tri-partite MoU on risk-based consolidated supervision where CBSL will be the lead regulator.

Further, initiatives have also been taken to strengthen other regulatory areas in the banking sector including recovery planning, cyber security and digitization for banks and sustainable finance.

3. Conclusion

As the apex institution in the financial sector, CBSL has the authority to administrate and regulate the financial system. Therefore, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is committed towards promoting a dynamic and resilient banking sector through the timely introduction of prudential policy measures, in line with regulatory and market developments and international best practices and effective implementation of same. This would help to preserve the stability of the banking system, whilst protecting depositors’ interests and enhancing public confidence.

The Central Bank is in the process of

reviewing the existing list of Qualified Auditors

to conduct audits of licensed banks under

the Banking Act. Accordingly, Expressions of

Interest were called from the Audit Firms for the

evaluation and selection to conduct audits for the

financial year commencing from 01 January 2020.

The assessment will be based on various factors

which include qualification of partners, staff

strength, experience and expertise and technical

competencies to audit banks.

Banking Act Directions on financial

derivatives were issued to licensed banks with

a view to strengthening risk management of

licensed banks. Accordingly, licensed banks are

required to have in place Board approved policies

and procedures on derivative transactions and risk

Standards were issued to licensed banks. This

direction was issued with the objective of ensuring a

stable funding profile in relation to the composition

of assets and off-balance sheet activities of

licensed banks. Accordingly, commencing from

01 January 2019 every licensed bank shall at all

times maintain an NSFR of 90 per cent which is to

be increased to 100 per cent from 01 July 2019.

Further, amendments to Banking Act Directions

No. 01 of 2015 on Liquidity Coverage Ratio under

Basel III Liquidity Standards was issued to licensed

banks in order to align the Directions in accordance

with the risk weight assigned to foreign claims of

government and to streamline the classification of

the customer base.

Banking Act Directions on foreign currency

borrowings were issued to licensed banks

introducing a new policy framework for

borrowings in foreign currency by licensed

banks. In terms of the new policy framework,

short-term and long-term limits on foreign currency

borrowings will be based on a certain percentage of

assets depending on a score based on the bank’s

external credit rating and the capital adequacy

ratio. The new Directions revoked the Banking

Act Directions No. 07 of 2017 on Foreign Currency

Borrowings by licensed banks and Circular

No. BD/FX/196 dated 13 January 1997 issued by

the Chief Accountant of the Central Bank.

A consultation paper on “Market Conduct

and Treasury Operations” was issued to

licensed banks with a view to further strengthen

the market conduct and practices of treasury

operations of licensed banks, and to ensure

that the treasury operations of licensed banks

are carried out prudently and in line with

international best practices. The proposed

regulatory framework covers inter alia market

conduct and ethical practices, confidentiality

requirements, procedure for recording deal

conversations, risk management principles,

professionalism, expertise and sanctions on

non-compliance with the Directions.

Banking Act Directions on “Leverage

Ratio under Basel III” were issued to licensed

banks with the aim of introducing a framework

with a simple, transparent and a non-risk

based Leverage Ratio to act as a credible

supplementary measure to the risk based

capital requirement. This is in order to restrict the

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

build-up of leverage in the banking sector, and to

avoid any destabilising deleveraging processes

which can damage the broader financial system

and the economy. Accordingly, commencing from

01 January 2019 the minimum leverage ratio of

3 per cent will be applicable to all licensed banks.

Further, due to the NSB Act mandating that

60 per cent of deposits in savings and deposit

accounts of the bank be invested in government

securities, a Circular was issued to NSB granting

permission to exclude investment in government

securities that represent 60 per cent of deposits in

savings and deposit accounts of the bank, from the

computation of leverage ratio exposure measure

for NSB.

A consultation paper on “Amendments

to the Banking Act Directions on Corporate

Governance” was issued to licensed banks.

The expected amendments purport to strengthen

the assessment of fitness and propriety of

Directors, CEOs and key management personnel

of licensed banks. Accordingly, more information

on qualifications and suitability of nominated/

appointed persons for the above positions is to

be obtained to facilitate the most suitable persons

to be appointed for the Board of Directors and

management positions of licensed banks. Further,

imposition of a cooling-off period will be considered

to avoid conflict of interest and to enhance the

accountability of these positions.

The Central Bank issued Guidelines to

licensed banks on Adoption of SLFRS 9:

Financial Instruments, to establish consistent

and prudent practices on the adoption of the

same by licensed banks. These guidelines were

prepared based on the ‘Guidance on Credit Risk

and Accounting for Expected Credit Losses’ issued

by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in

December 2015, the best practices and guidelines

issued by monetary authorities/financial sector

regulators on implementation of International

Financial Reporting Standards 9: Financial

Instruments, and taking into consideration

the comments from the Institute of Chartered

Accountants of Sri Lanka, Panel of Auditors and

licensed banks in this regard. Accordingly, licensed

banks are required to adhere to these Guidelines

(in addition to the existing applicable regulations)

as a minimum; on classification and measurement of

financial assets and financial liabilities, management

of credit risk, impairment of financial assets, valuation

of collateral, role of the internal audit, regulatory and

reporting requirements when preparing, presenting

and publishing financial statements.

A new supervisory rating model (Bank

Sustainability Rating Indicator-BSRI) was

developed by the Central Bank with a view

to facilitating the risk based supervision

framework of licensed banks and to enable early

intervention and prompt corrective actions

for licensed banks. Accordingly, risk based

examinations based on the BSRI was commenced

with effect from 01 January 2019. Going forward,

the Central Bank will continue to review and

strengthen banking sector regulations in line with

international standards and best practices in order

to ensure the stability and sustainability of the

financial sector while increasing the resilience of

the financial system to global and domestic shocks

while protecting the interest of depositors.

8.3 Performance of Non-Bank Financial Institutions

Licensed Finance Companies and Specialised Leasing Companies Sector

The performance of the Licensed Finance

Companies (LFCs) and Specialised Leasing

Companies (SLCs) sector moderated during the

year in terms of credit growth, profitability and

non-performing loans. Fiscal and macroprudential

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

policy measures taken to curtail importation and credit

granted for, purchasing motor vehicles negatively

affected the demand for core lending products in the

sector. Further, it is observed that the LFCs and SLCs

are gradually moving away from vehicle financing

to other secured lending activities. However, the

sector expanded in 2018, with an asset growth of

5.6 per cent and represented 7.6 per cent of

Sri Lanka’s financial sector assets by end 2018. The

sector as a whole maintained capital at a healthy

level along with adequate liquidity buffers above the

regulatory minimum levels. The sector also exhibited

a shift in the funding mix, as increased assets were

mainly funded through borrowings while deposits

increased slightly compared to high growth recorded

during the previous year. The Central Bank continued

to take prudential measures to maintain stability of the

sector with much consideration on reviving several

companies with weak financial positions.

Business Growth

(a) Outreach: The sector comprised of 43

LFCs and 5 SLCs at end 2018. LFCs and SLCs

contributed to the economy by providing enhanced

services to the customers and expanding its branch

network. At end 2018, there were 1,373 branches

and 658 other outlets of the LFCs and SLCs sector,

out of which 927 branches (68 per cent) were

concentrated outside the Western Province.

(b) Assets: The expansion of total assets

slowed down, recording a growth rate of

5.6 per cent (Rs. 76.3 billion) during the year

reaching Rs.1,431.3 billion compared to the

11.8 per cent growth reported in 2017. The asset

base of the sector mainly consists of loans and

advances which accounted for 79.4 per cent of the

sector assets. Finance leases accounted for the

highest share of loans and advances, representing

52.8 per cent followed by other secured loans

(38 per cent).

Lending activities of the sector showed

signs of slowing down in response to fiscal

and macroprudential policy measures taken

to curtail importation of motor vehicles

and lending towards vehicles and the slow

down in economic activities among other

reasons. Credit provided by the LFCs and SLCs

sector grew by 7.6 per cent (Rs. 79.9 billion)

to Rs.1,137 billion compared to the growth of

9.8 per cent in the corresponding period of 2017.

The expansion in finance leases contributed

to 84.5 per cent of the credit growth while

16.1 per cent was through secured loans and

advances. The hire purchase portfolio contracted

during the year by Rs. 8 billion (29.7 per cent).

However, the growth of finance lease portfolio

for the year 2018 was 14.7 per cent compared

to growth of 13 per cent recorded in year 2017.

The investment portfolio of the LFCs and

SLCs sector, comprises of investment in

equities, capital market debt instruments,

government securities and Investment

properties. Investment portfolio recorded a

negative growth of 7.1 per cent to Rs 109.7 billion

in 2018 compared to a growth of 5.7 per cent to

Rs. 118.1 billion in 2017 mainly due to the decline

in market value of investments in subsidiaries,

associates and unit trusts. Other assets,

mainly maintained in the form of cash, balances

with banks and financial institutions, trading

stocks, and fixed assets showed an increase of

2.7 per cent in 2018 largely due to increased

placements in banks and financial institutions.

(c) Liabilities: Customer deposits still

dominate the major portion of liabilities

which accounted for 50.1 per cent of the total

liabilities of the sector. Borrowings recorded

a growth of 17.1 per cent (Rs. 67.8 billion) in

2018, a shift from the negative growth recorded

in the year 2017. Deposit growth slowed down

to 4.4 per cent, compared with the growth of

29.4 per cent recorded in the corresponding

period of 2017. The sector showed a reliance on

bank borrowings over deposits due to flexibility and

negative public perception towards LFCs which

reduced the funds mobilized through deposits.

The growth in deposits were mainly

attributed to the declining trend in deposit

interest rates. The capital elements of the sector

increased by 8.2 per cent to Rs.183.7 billion at

end 2018, mainly on account of the increase in

capital due to steps taken by LFCs to enhance

the minimum core capital to meet the Rs. 1.5

billion requirement by 01 January 2019 and due

to accumulation of profits for the financial year

2017/18.

Risks in the LFCs and SLCs Sector

(a) Credit Risk: The gross non-performing

advances (NPAs) ratio increased to 7.7 per cent

in 2018 compared to 5.9 per cent reported in

2017. This is the highest NPA ratio recorded since

February 2015. The main reasons attributable to

this increase are unfavourable weather conditions

during 2017 and slowing down in economic

activities in 2018. Further, the provision coverage

ratio declined to 57 per cent in 2018 compared to

64 per cent reported in 2017. As a result, net NPA

ratio also increased to 2.4 per cent in 2018 from

the reported ratio of 1.6 per cent in 2017 showing

signs of deterioration in the asset quality of the

sector. It is expected that NPA will rise further if

extreme weather conditions prevail and due to

spillover effect of the Debt Relief program that was

introduced by the Ministry of Finance and Mass

Media in August 2018. Further, implementation

of SLFRS 9 is also expected to be a challenge for

credit risk of the sector.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

(b) Market Risk: The LFCs and SLCs sector

continued to experience a minimal market risk

due to the lower exposure to trading portfolio

and foreign currency transactions.

Interest Rate Risk: Along with the gradual

increase in the interest rates during the year,

interest rate risk of the sector slightly increased.

Despite the prevailing negative mismatch in the

maturity profile of the interest-bearing assets and

liabilities, the sector was able to maintain a positive

net interest margin.

Prices of Equity: Equity risk of the sector remained

low during the year as the exposure to equity

market in the form of investment in listed shares

was minimal at Rs. 14.3 billion, which was only

1 per cent of the total assets of the sector.

(c) Liquidity Risk: The overall statutory

liquid assets available in the sector during 2018

indicated a surplus of Rs. 25.6 billion as against

the stipulated minimum requirement of Rs.88.2

billion. However, the surplus liquid assets declined

during 2018 compared to the surplus liquid assets level

of Rs. 35.5 billion in 2017. Further, the liquid assets to

total assets ratio reduced to 7.6 per cent from 8.9 per

cent in 2017. The liquid asset to deposits ratio also

was well above the statutory minimum requirement

of 10 per cent of time deposits and borrowings, and

15 per cent of savings deposits at end December 2018.

Profitability and Capital Resources

(a) Profitability: The net interest income

of the sector increased at a slower rate than

in 2017, recording a growth of 6 per cent to

Rs. 108.8 billion. This was mainly due to increase

in interest income by 4.3 per cent and the growth

of interest expenses by 2.9 per cent. As a result,

the net interest margin (net interest income as

a percentage of average assets) of the sector

declined marginally to 7.4 per cent in 2018 from

7.7 per cent in 2017. However, non-interest income

increased by 11.9 per cent mainly due to increase

in default charges and other service charges

while non-interest expenses also increased by

1.5 per cent adversely affecting the sector

profitability mainly due to increase in staff costs. The

loan loss provisions made against NPLs increased

by Rs.12.4 billion during 2018 when compared to

the provision of Rs. 13.5 billion made in 2017. The

sector posted a profit after tax of Rs. 21.4 billion

which declined by 17.2 per cent compared to the

profit recorded in year 2017 mainly due to increased

funding cost and higher loan loss provisions. ROA

also decreased by 51 basis points during the year,

reporting a ratio of 2.7 per cent and ROE declined

nearly by 400 basis points, reporting a ratio of

12.1 per cent which shows sign of stress towards

profitability of the sector.

(b) Capital: The sector maintained its

overall capital level well above the minimum

requirement during the year enhancing the

resilience to any perceived adverse shocks.

The total regulatory capital levels improved by

Rs. 15.5 billion in 2018 compared to the figures

reported in 2017, mainly due to the enhancement

of the minimum capital requirement by the Central

Bank to Rs. 1 billion from 01 January 2018. This

minimum requirement is further increased to Rs.1.5

billion by 01 January 2019.

However, the sector core capital and total

risk weighted capital adequacy ratios decreased

to 9.9 per cent and 11.2 per cent in 2018

from the reported levels of 12.4 per cent and

13.1 per cent in 2017 as the companies had

to report risk weighted assets with a more

risk sensitive focus covering credit risk and

operational risk under new capital adequacy

framework. LFCs and SLCs are required to

maintain minimum Tier I capital adequacy ratio

of 6 per cent and total capital ratio of 10 per cent

with effect from 01 July 2018 under the new capital

adequacy framework. The regulatory capital

comprises of Tier I and Tier II capital of which

Tier I capital contributed to 97 per cent of the total

regulatory capital. Tier I capital mainly comprises

of issued share capital, statutory reserve fund and

published retained profits. Subordinated term debt

is 63.9 per cent of Tier II capital while revaluation

reserves represents 10.3 per cent. However, there

levels of Rs. 1.5 billion by 01 January 2019 due

to weak financial positions and regulatory actions

were taken against those companies.

Supervisory and Regulatory Developments

Throughout 2018, the Central Bank initiated

several policy measures to strengthen the

supervisory and regulatory framework of LFCs

and SLCs with the aim of enhancing stability

and soundness of the sector and increasing

the customer protection and confidence. The

“Financial Customer Protection Framework” was

issued in the form of a Direction which emphasizes

minimum standards for customer protection in the

areas of disclosure and transparency, financial

education and awareness, responsible business

conduct, complaint handling and redress, equitable

and fair treatment and protection of customer

data and privacy. A Direction was issued to

regularise the valuation procedure of the LFCs

and SLCs regarding immovable properties.

Further, a new Capital Adequacy Framework for

LFCs and SLCs was implemented with a view to

fostering a strong emphasis on risk management

and to encourage ongoing improvements in

LFCs and SLCs’ risk assessment capabilities.

A new Direction on “Outsourcing of Business

Operations” was introduced to standardise the

outsourcing arrangements by introducing a risk

management guideline to manage the risk arising

from outsourcing and to impose restrictions on

outsourcing core business functions/operations

and activities. A new Direction on “Maximum Rate

of Interest on Microfinance Loans” was introduced

for LFCs and SLCs with the objective of protecting

customers from being charged with exorbitant

interest rates for microfinance loans. LTV Ratio

on vehicle imports was further revised to curtail

imports requiring LFCs and SLCs to adopt the

new ratio with effect from 01 October 2018. A

circular was issued in March 2018, where LFCs

were required to obtain a credit rating from a credit

rating agency acceptable to the Central Bank and

required to publish such rating with effect from

01 October 2018.

Primary Dealers in Government Securities

At the end of 2018, there were 7 Licensed

Commercial Banks and 8 companies registered

as Primary Dealers. Out of those, Perpetual

Treasuries Limited (PTL) and Pan Asia Banking

Corporation PLC (PABC), have been suspended

from carrying out business and activities of a Primary

Dealer (PTL w.e.f. 06 July 2017 and PABC w.e.f.

15 August 2017) by the Central Bank. Participation

in government securities primary auctions was

prohibited for Entrust Securities PLC (ESP) w.e.f.

24 July 2017 and resolution action has also been

initiated on ESP. Therefore, currently 6 Licensed

and available for sale portfolio, increased to Rs. 5.2

billion compared to Rs. 3 billion at end 2017.

Held to maturity portfolio increased marginally by

0.7 per cent to Rs. 8.7 billion at the end 2018 from

Rs. 8.6 billion at the end of 2017.

Profitability: The PD companies reported

profit after tax of Rs. 0.2 billion during 2018

against that of Rs. 2.8 billion during 2017. The

significant revaluation losses from government

securities has largely contributed to the decline in

profits. Consequently, the ROA and ROE ratios

for PD companies decreased to 0.02 per cent and

2.0 per cent, respectively, at the end 2018 from

4.2 per cent and 12.9 per cent recorded in 2017.

Capital: Equity of PD companies considerably

declined by 50.1 per cent largely due to the

suspension of a PD company and concentration

on repo borrowings to fund the total assets

growth. The Risk Weighted Capital Adequacy Ratio

(RWCAR) of the PD companies was above the

minimum RWCAR of 10 per cent even though the

ratio decreased to 21.3 per cent at the end of 2018

from 55.9 per cent at the end 2017.

Exposure to Risks

Market Risk: The ratio of trading portfolio to

the total investment portfolio of PD companies

has not changed notably and recorded at

81.9 per cent at end 2018 compared to

81.4 per cent at end 2017. This reflects a marginal

increase in the market risk exposure of the industry.

Liquidity Risk: The overall liquidity risk

exposure of PD companies increased due to

the increase in over-night negative mismatch in

the maturity profile of assets and liabilities of

the industry at end 2018. The overnight negative

mismatch increased significantly to Rs. 41.3 billion

or 92.8 per cent of the overnight liabilities at end

Commercial Banks (LCBs) and 6 Primary Dealer

(PD) Companies are active in the PD industry in

the government securities market.

Assets and Liabilities

The total assets of PD companies increased

to Rs 83.6 billion in 2018 resulting growth in

assets increasing from 0.3 per cent in 2017 to

8.1 per cent in 2018. The total investment portfolio

of government securities, consisting of trading,

available for sale and held to maturity amounted to

Rs. 76.7 billion at end 2018, recording an increase

of 22.6 per cent over 2017. This change was due to

increases in the trading portfolio and the available

for sale portfolio of government securities. The

trading portfolio increased to Rs. 62.8 billion at end

2018, from Rs. 50.9 billion recorded at end 2017

2018, from Rs. 1.1 billion or 9.5 per cent at end

2017. In view of holding a large volume of risk

free government securities by PD companies and

also the ability to use such government securities

as collateral for obtaining funds to bridge any

unforeseen liquidity gaps, the liquidity risk profile

of PD companies remained low throughout the

year except for one PD who was facing liquidity

issues. Most of the PD companies had stand-by

contingency funding arrangements to bridge any

liquidity gaps.

Market Participation

Primary Market Activities: The participation

in Treasury bills and Treasury bonds by PDs

has showed a mixed performance. Of the total

bids accepted from the total Treasury bills auctions

(51) conducted in 2018, the participation of Bank

PDs, PD companies and Employees’ Provident

Fund (EPF) is accounted to 70.5 per cent,

25.6 per cent and 3.8 per cent, respectively.

However, participation in Treasury bond

auctions in 2018 is dominated by the EPF with

46.3 per cent share from the total bonds accepted

through 11 auctions conducted in 2018.

Secondary Market Activities: Secondary

market transactions in government securities

decreased significantly by 10.5 per cent to

Rs. 7,529.2 billion during 2018 compared to

2017, of which Repo transactions accounted for

82.9 per cent of the total volume of secondary

market transactions in 2018. During 2018,

outright purchases and outright sales increased

by 2.9 per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively,

compared to the values in 2017.

Unit Trusts

Number of Unit Trusts (UT) in operation

at end 2018 were 75 which had declined by 4

during the year. The number of UT management

companies remained at 14 in year 2018. From the

total 75 UT funds, 16 operated as Income Funds,

15 Money Market Funds, 14 Gilt Edged Funds,

11 operated as balanced funds, 8 Growth Funds,

4 Index Funds, 4 Shariah Funds, 2 Initial Public

Offering Funds and 1 dollar Bond Fund.

Business Growth

Contraction in UT sector assets was noted

during year 2018, decreasing the asset base by

101 per cent to Rs. 64.2 billion at end December

2018. Simultaneously, the number of units issued

also declined to 3,368 in 2018 compared to 7,683

issued in 2017. However, the total number of unit

holders increased marginally to 42,093 in 2018

from 41,037 in 2017. The Net Asset Value also

declined considerably to Rs. 64.2 billion at end

2018, when compared to Rs. 128.8 billion at end

2017.

Investment

A notable decrease in investment in

government securities as a percentage of net

assets was observed in 2018. The share of

investment in government securities declined to

3.8 per cent at end 2018 compared to 17.7 per cent

at end 2017. Investment in government securities

decreased substantially by 88.9 per cent in 2018

significantly by 27 per cent at end 2018.

Insurance Sector

The insurance sector reported a

moderate growth during year 2018 in terms

of assets. A total of 26 insurance companies

were in operation at end 2018, out of which

12 companies operated as exclusive general

insurance companies, 12 companies operated

as exclusive long-term insurance companies

and 2 companies were involved in both

long-term and general insurance business. The

number of insurance companies listed in the

Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) remained at

Brokering Companies in 2018, where 2 new

companies joined the industry in 2018. These

brokering companies are either engaged

exclusively on general insurance business or in

both general and long-term insurance business.

expansion of 7.4 per cent at end 2018 with

an increase in the asset base from Rs. 564.9

billion at end 2017 to Rs. 606.6 billion. The long-

term insurance subsector recorded a growth of

insurance subsector has recorded a growth of

2.7 per cent and reached an asset base of

Rs. 177.1 billion at end 2018. The share of the

long-term insurance subsector, in terms of the

total assets of the insurance sector remained

high at 70.8 per cent at end 2018 compared

to 69.5 per cent at end 2017. Accordingly, the

general insurance subsector has further reduced

its share in total assets of the insurance sector to

29.2 per cent at end 2018 as against 30.5 per cent

at end 2017.

The overall gross written premium of the

sector recorded a growth of 12.6 per cent at end

2018. The growth of gross written premium of the

long-term insurance subsector was 12.7 per cent

whereas the gross written premium of the general

insurance subsector was 12.5 per cent at end 2018.

Nevertheless, the general insurance subsector has

been the main contributor for the insurance sector

gross written premium with a share of 54.3 per cent.

The gross written premium of the motor insurance

category which is the most significant category

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

in the general insurance subsector grew by

12.9 per cent during the period under consideration.

The fire insurance category has grown by

3.7 per cent and the marine insurance category has

grown by 8.3 per cent. However, a drop in the gross

written premium is observed in the health insurance

category which is a decline by 11.6 per cent.

Earnings

The total profits of the insurance

sector recorded a considerable decline of

38.4 per cent during 2018. This was mainly

attributable to the drop in profits by three

long-term insurance companies. In addition, the

profit recorded in 2017 was extraordinary as it

was resulted from some long-term insurance

companies making one off surplus transfers which

emerged as a result of changing the valuation

method of policy holder liabilities, to comply with

regulations of the IRCSL. Accordingly, the drop in

the long-term insurance subsector was 48.5 per

cent in 2018. Meanwhile an increase in the profits

of the general insurance subsector was observed at

8.3 per cent during 2018. The underwriting profits

of the insurance sector increased to Rs. 13.1 billion

in 2018 from Rs. 12.7 billion recorded in 2017.

Total claims of the insurance sector

increased to Rs. 81.6 billion from Rs. 68.1

billion recording a growth of 19.9 per cent

during year 2018. The long-term insurance

subsector claims have significantly increased by

37.5 per cent, whereas the claims of the general

insurance subsector has moderately increased by

9.1 per cent during 2018.

The total investment income of the

insurance sector has also indicated a growth of

8.4 per cent during year 2018. The ROA of

the long-term insurance subsector decreased

substantially to 4.9 per cent in line with the drop

in profits recorded during this period. This trend

is also reflected in ROE reporting a decrease of

25 per cent during 2018 compared to

44.4 per cent during 2017. Meanwhile, the ROA of

the general insurance subsector remained more or

less similar at 5.4 per cent during 2018, whereas,

ROE slightly increased to 11.2 per cent in 2018 from

10.5 per cent in 2017.

Capital and Investment

Capital to total assets of the long-term

insurance subsector declined to 22 per cent

from 23 per cent at end 2017, whereas the capital

to total assets ratio of the general insurance

subsector slightly improved to 48 per cent at

end 2018 from 47 per cent at end 2017. The drop

in profits may have been accountable to the decline

in capital of the long-term insurance subsector.

Further, one insurance company failed to comply

with the Risk Based Capital Adequacy requirement

imposed by the IRCSL in 2018.

The investments made by the insurance

sector continued to be highly concentrated

on government securities. Nevertheless, the

long-term insurance subsector assets on

government securities decreased to 29 per cent at

end 2018 compared with 32.5 per cent at end 2017.

However, the general insurance subsector assets

on government securities increased slightly to

7 per cent at end 2018 from 6.2 per cent reported

at end 2017. When considering the share on

As per the Employees’ Provident Fund

(EPF) Act. No. 15 of 1958, the Monetary Board

of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is entrusted

with the custodianship of the Fund while the

Commissioner of Labour is entrusted with the

end 2018 from Rs. 2,066.3 billion recorded at

end 2017 registering a 10.8 per cent growth.

This increase was due to the combined effect of

net contributions of the members (contributions

less refund payments) and the income generated

through investments of the Fund. Total liability to

the members stood at Rs. 2,254.2 billion at end

2018 recording an 11.6 per cent increase from

Rs. 2,020.8 billion at end 2017. The total

contribution for the year 2018 increased by

8.8 per cent to Rs. 145.0 billion while the total

amount of refunds made to the members and their

legal heirs in 2018 was Rs.108.0 billion, which was

a decrease of 8.0 per cent over 2017. Accordingly,

the net contribution was Rs. 37.0 billion compared

to Rs. 15.8 billion recorded in the previous year.

investment on equity of the general insurance

subsector decreased to 2.1 per cent at end 2018

compared to 3.2 per cent at end 2017.

Supervisory and Regulatory

Developments

Several regulatory and supervisory

developments were initiated by the IRCSL in

2018. A Direction on corporate governance was

issued to ensure greater transparency in insurance

business. Further, directions on operational

matters such as management of insurance funds

and treatment of one-off surplus have been issued

to long-term insurance companies. Furthermore,

some regulations have been amended in line with

the new developments of the insurance sector.

With regard to supervisory actions, a procedure

for taking enforcement actions on non-compliance

with provisions of reporting requirements has been

enforced by the IRCSL.

Superannuation Funds

The assets of the superannuation funds

stood at Rs. 2,807.7 billion at end 2018 and were

estimated to account for 14.8 per cent of the

financial sector assets. The sector is dominated

by the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), which

accounts for about 81.5 per cent of the assets of

the superannuation sector. In addition to EPF, there

are two other publicly managed funds, namely,

the Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF) and the Public

Service Provident Fund (PSPF). Further, there

were 123 privately managed Approved Pension

and Provident Funds (APPFs) operative in Sri

Lanka at end 2018.

The annual profit of the Fund decreased by

6.1 per cent to Rs.190.6 billion in 2018 from

Rs. 202.9 billion from the previous year. This

was mainly due to the increase in the income tax

expense of the fund as per the Inland Revenue Act

No. 24 of 2017 and the marked to market losses

from listed equity investments with the adoption of

new Accounting Standard on Financial Instruments

in 2018.

(b) Investment of Funds and Return: The

total investment portfolio (book value) of the

Fund grew by 15.4 per cent to Rs. 2,298.8 billion

at end 2018 from Rs. 1,992.4 billion at end 2017.

The investment policy of the Fund focused on

providing a long-term positive real rate of return to

the members while ensuring the safety of the Fund

and availability of adequate level of liquidity to

meet refund payments and other expenses of the

Fund. Accordingly, at end of 2018, the investment

portfolio consisted of 92.2 per cent in government

securities, 3.3 per cent in equity, 1.9 per cent in

corporate debentures and trust certificates, 1.5 in

fixed deposits and the remaining 1.1 per cent in

Reverse Repurchase agreements.

The total investment income of the Fund

was Rs. 222.4 billion in 2018, and recorded a

decrease of 0.1 per cent compared to previous

year. Interest income including amortization gains

continued to be the major source of income to the

Fund which grew by 4.5 per cent to Rs. 229.4 billion

in 2018 from Rs. 219.6 billion in 2017. Dividend

income also increased by 29.9 per cent to Rs. 3.9

billion in 2018 compared to Rs. 3.0 billion in 2017.

Net loss on financial instruments at fair value

through profit or loss recorded a loss of Rs. 10.9

billion in 2018 compared to net gain of Rs. 1.5

billion in 2017.

The Fund earned a total gross income of

Rs. 222.8 billion in 2018, recording a decrease

of 0.2 per cent compared with the previous

year. EPF was able to earn 10.4 per cent return

on investment in 2018 while maintaining operating

expenses to gross income ratio at 0.7 per cent

in 2018. With the introduction of the new Inland

Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017, which was effective

from 01 April 2018, the income tax rate applicable

for the Fund increased from 10 per cent to

14 per cent, which resulted in an increase of Rs. 12

billion in the tax expenditure when compared with

the previous year. Furthermore, the Withholding

Tax (WHT) of 10 per cent paid on Treasury bond

interest income which had been recognized as

a part of gross income under the previous tax

regulations has been abolished with effect from

01 April 2018. Also, the adoption of SLFRS 9, the

Accounting Standard applicable for classification

and measurement of Financial Instruments,

where listed equity instruments were measured

at fair value and under the prevailed market

conditions, a marked to market loss of Rs. 10.9

billion was charged against the profit for the year

2018. Due to these reasons, the profit available

for distribution decreased by Rs. 10 billion or by

4.9 per cent compared to 2017. However, EPF

has taken measures to declare an interest rate of

9.5 per cent on member balances in 2018 partly

utilising the funds in the Profit Equalization Reserve.

(c) Risk Management: In 2018, a number

of measures have been taken for improving the

overall risk management framework of the EPF,

with a view of enhancing the accountability

and transparency of the investment activities.

As a result, new Investment Policy Statement

and Investment Guidelines have been developed

incorporating these requirements. While the EPF is in

the overall risk management framework of the Central

Bank several initiatives were taken to strengthen the

governance structure of the EPF risk management.

This includes the establishment of EPF Investment

Oversight Committee (EIOC) to oversee the

investment activities of the EPF by providing strategic

and policy guidance for the management of the

Fund and the EIOC delegates its duties and powers

with respect to the day-to-day decision-making

function of the EPF fund management activities to a

departmental level committee called EPF Investment

Committee (EIC). Further, Risk Management

Department of the Central Bank, as the second line of

defence carries out the risk oversight activities of the

EPF and reports to the Monetary Board through the

Board Risk Oversight Committee of the Central Bank

on a regular basis. Therefore, risk mitigation activities

which address both financial and non-financial risks

of the Fund and the actions pertaining to strengthen

the internal controls relating to operational activities

have been continued throughout the year.

Employees’ Trust Fund

The Employees’ Trust Fund which accounts

for 11.1 per cent of the asset base of the

superannuation sector reported a healthy

growth in 2018 in terms of assets. The ETF

has around 14.6 million accounts, of which

only 2.6 million were active, at end 2018. The

number of employers contributing to the fund

increased to 82,416 , at end 2018 compared

to 81,515 recorded at end 2017. The total

outstanding member balances in the ETF rose by

2.5 per cent and stood at Rs. 281.1 billion at end

2018. Meanwhile, total contributions decreased by

2.2 per cent to Rs. 22.3 billion, while total benefits

paid out increased by 8.9 per cent to Rs. 18.8 billion,

resulting in a significant decrease of 36.9 per cent

in the net inflow of funds during the year. However,

total assets of the fund amounted to Rs. 312.1

billion, recording a growth of 11.9 per cent at end

2018 compared to the growth of 12.1 per cent at

end 2017. The total investments of the ETF rose

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

by 11.1 per cent to Rs. 291.7 billion at end

2018. The share of investments in government

securities reduced to 75.1 per cent at end 2018

from the 78.2 per cent recorded at end 2017. The

ETF has made arrangements to reinvest inflows

from divested government securities in term

deposits. Investments in equity and corporate

fixed income securities accounted for 4.0 per cent

and 1.0 per cent, respectively, of total investments

during the year, and the fund managed to secure

a rate of return of 8.4 per cent on its investments.

Other Superannuation Funds

The Public Service Provident Fund (PSPF),

which represents 2 per cent of the superannuation

sector, contracted in terms of the number of

members and net contributions, while its assets

grew during the year. The active members of the

fund declined to 227,816 at end 2018 compared to

228,214 recorded at end 2017. Total assets grew

by 3.1 per cent and stood at Rs. 57.2 billion while

investments of the PSPF grew by 4.5 per cent to

55.3 billion in 2018. The positive net contribution

was declined to Rs. 381.2 million in 2018, compared

to Rs. 843.8 million in 2017. The investments in

government securities accounted for 48.8 per cent

of total investments. The rate of return on member

balances was 13 per cent for 2018.

APPFs accounts for 5.3 per cent of the

superannuation sector and recorded a contraction

in 2018. The number of approved provident funds

declined to 123 at end 2018 with the winding up of

26 funds due to cessation of workers, bankruptcy

of companies and transferring funds to the Central

Bank. Accordingly, the number of members covered

by private provident funds reduced to 134,456 at end

2018 from 169,257 recorded in 2017. Further, total

assets of the APPFs is estimated to be Rs. 149.1

billion at end 2018. This is a 65.9 per cent reduction

of the asset base of Rs. 437.3 billion recorded at end

2017. Investment portfolios of such funds amounted

to Rs. 114.8 billion at 2018, which recorded a

57 per cent negative growth.

The Average Weighted Call Money Rate

(AWCMR), which serves as the operating target

of the enhanced monetary policy framework,

responded swiftly to policy rate changes in

2018. Policy interest rates of the Central Bank

were revised in two instances in 2018 impacting

the movements in AWCMR. The AWCMR, which

was at 8.15 per cent at end December 2017,

Market Liquidity

Rupee liquidity in the domestic money market,

which displayed both positive and negative

levels until mid-September 2018, turned to

a persistently negative condition during the

latter part of 2018. Liquidity position turned into

a persistently high deficit mainly due to foreign

exchange related transactions carried out by

the Central Bank. However, variation of liquidity

level witnessed during the year was mainly led

by government transactions with the Central

Bank. Purchase of government securities by the

Central Bank increased liquidity, while maturing

of such securities led to a decline in liquidity

levels. Similarly, forward transactions initiated

by the Treasury with the Central Bank raised

market liquidity, while reversal of these forward

transactions reduced market liquidity. Margin

continued to remain closer to that level with the

surplus liquidity in the domestic money market

until end March 2018. Some transitory increase

in the AWCMR was observed towards end March

2018 due to the misinterpretation of the effect of

the withholding tax adjustment by commercial

banks. In response to the reduction of the

Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) by 25

basis points at the beginning of April, the AWCMR

declined below 8 per cent. The wide gap prevailed

between AWCMR and Average Weighted Repo

Rate (AWRR) narrowed and both rates moved

closely with the removal of the notional tax on

government security transactions from April 2018.

Although AWCMR remained within the policy

rate corridor since April, it increased towards

the upper bound of the corridor by mid-2018

and remained around the same levels during the

remainder of the year except for a short period

during July-September 2018. With the increase

in Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) by 75

basis points to 8.00 per cent and the SLFR by 50

basis points to 9.00 per cent in November 2018,

both the AWCMR and the AWRR continued to

hover around the upper bound of the corridor.

Accordingly, AWCMR and the AWRR remained

at 8.95 per cent and 9.00 per cent, respectively,

at end December 2018. As a result of policy

rate changes in 2018, the width of the policy

rate corridor narrowed to 100 basis points from

150 basis points. The AWCMR, which remained

closer to the upper bound of the policy rate

corridor until end February 2019, indicated a

downward adjustment following the policy actions

by the Central Bank to reduce SRR with effect

from 01 March 2019 with a view to inject market

liquidity as well as the monetary operations of the

Central Bank to provide liquidity to the domestic

money market.

requirements were imposed in September 2018 for

Letters of Credit opened with commercial banks for

importation of motor vehicles and non - essential

consumer goods with the view of reducing import

demand to curtail the pressure on the exchange

rate to depreciate. Imposition of 100 per cent

reserve requirement on such margins considerably

increased the required reserves to be maintained

by LCBs with the Central Bank leading to a decline

in liquidity in the domestic money market at the

same proportion. The SRR applicable to rupee

deposit liabilities of commercial banks was reduced

by 1.50 percentage points to 6.00 per cent from

7.50 per cent with effect from 16 November 2018.

As a result of the SRR reduction, about Rs. 90

billion was injected into the market aiding to reduce

the pressure on money market liquidity. Liquidity

management operations were carried out by the

Central Bank aimed at keeping the AWCMR within

the policy rate corridor consistent with the monetary

policy stance, while avoiding large fluctuations

in AWCMR and maintaining adequate liquidity in

the market to facilitate smooth functioning of the

payments and settlements system. Accordingly,

the Central Bank actively engaged in Open Market

Operations (OMOs) by conducting overnight, short

term and long-term reverse repurchase auctions

to inject liquidity on a temporary basis and also

outright Treasury-bill purchases to inject liquidity to

the market on a permanent basis. As the liquidity

deficit continued to remain high, the Central Bank

reduced SRR by further 1.00 percentage points to

5.00 per cent in February 2019 to be effected from

01 March 2019 to reduce the liquidity deficit in the

domestic money market.

Monetary policy implementation process

encountered few issues. The spread between

the SLFR and primary market Treasury bills yields

of 91 days, 182 days and 364 days continued to

increase and stood at 101 basis points, 87 basis

points and 170 basis points, respectively, at end

2018. A higher spread could lead to arbitrage gains

for market participants by exploiting the OMO

and standing facilities. Despite high AWCMR,

LCBs were compelled to borrow funds without

collaterals from the call money market at higher

rates than that of OMO auctions in order to comply

with the requirement of maintaining the Minimum

Liquidity Asset Ratio. The high liquidity deficit

in the market was triggered by the continued

borrowing, particularly by domestic bank, while

considerable liquidity was concentrated on foreign

banks. Asymmetric distribution of liquidity among

market participants also led some participant’s

to continuously borrow from the Central Bank.

As the excessive reliance on OMO facilities by

non-bank primary dealers affected the efficiency of

the signaling effect of OMOs, from 25 September

2018 the participation of non-bank Primary Dealers

at OMO auctions was restricted. However,

standing facility and ILF facility continued to be

available without any restrictions to all Participating

Institutions.

Access to real time accurate information on

money market transactions is critical to facilitate

the price discovery of the money market. The

Central Integrated Market Monitor (CIMM) was

introduced to LCBs, PDs and Money Brokers with

effect from 1 March 2018 to report information on

call money, foreign exchange and government

security markets. CIMM also requires LCBs and

PDs to report highly accurate liquidity estimates

before 08:30 hours on each working day to prepare

the daily liquidity estimate of the banking system.

Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

Sri Lankan rupee depreciated significantly

against the US dollar during the year. Four

consecutive interest rate hikes by the Federal

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

281

Reserve Bank, USA which resulted in severe

capital flight, together with high importer demand

for US dollars caused a substantial depreciation of

the Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar. The

pressure was aggravated due to the prolonged

political instability ensued during the last 3 months

of the year. Further, significant foreign debt service

payments befell during the year as well as, the

negative sentiment created through the delayed

6th tranche of EFF from the IMF contributed to

the extreme pressure on the exchange rate.

Accordingly, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated

against the US dollar by a notable 16.36 per cent,

from Rs. 152.85 reported at end 2017 to Rs. 182.75

at end 2018, while the respective depreciation

recorded in 2017 was only 2 percent. In line with

the overall depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee

against the US dollar, the average US dollar buying

and selling exchange rates of Licensed Commercial

Banks for telegraphic transfers at end 2018 were

recorded at Rs. 180.72 and Rs. 184.70, whilst

comparative figures at end 2017 were Rs. 151.31

and Rs. 155.15, respectively.

During the year, the Sri Lankan rupee

depreciated against other major currencies in

line with the depreciation against US dollar.

Although uncertainties that emerged from the

‘Brexit’ caused the Sterling Pound to depreciate

against the US dollar, the pressure on the Sri Lankan

rupee against US dollar surpassed the depreciation

of GBP against US dollar. Consequently, the

Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 11.35 per cent

against the Sterling Pound during 2018. Similarly,

the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 12.68 per cent

against the Euro as the general depreciation of

the Euro against the US dollar resulting from the

strengthened dollar was not sufficient to overcome

the adverse impact on exchange rate between

Sri Lankan rupee and Euro. Owing to the trade

war between USA and China, excessive demand

created over Japanese Yen as a safe-heaven asset

within an environment of geopolitical uncertainty

and the general depreciation of Sri Lankan rupee

against the US dollar, led for the Sri Lankan

rupee to depreciate against the Japanese Yen by

18.06 per cent and Indian rupee by 8.72 per cent

during the year.

The Central Bank was a net seller in the

domestic foreign exchange market in 2018.

The Central Bank absorbed US dollars 557

million during the first three months of the year

from the market. However, in order to combat

the continued pressure on the exchange rate and

to curb the excessive volatility whille facilitating

capital outflows, the Central Bank supplied US

dollars 1,676 million to the market. Accordingly,

the Central Bank supplied US dollars 1,120 million

to the domestic foreign exchange market on a net

basis during the year.

During 2018, trading volumes in the domestic

foreign exchange market recorded a significant

increase of 12.7 per cent compared to the previous

year. Transaction volumes of foreign exchange in the

domestic inter-bank market increased to US dollars

17,402 million in 2018 from US dollars 16,451 million

in 2017. In line with this, the daily average volumes in

the inter-bank foreign exchange market also increased

to US dollars 73 million in 2018 in comparison to US

dollars 68 million recorded in 2017.

Government Securities Market

Reflecting the high debt service payments

and tight government cash flow requirements

during the first quarter of the year, the

downward adjustment in Treasury bill yield

rates observed since the second half of 2017

was reversed starting from early part of 2018.

However, the reduction of the Standing Lending

Facility Rate (SLFR) by 25 bps to 8.50 per cent

effective from 4 April 2018 contributed to moderate

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

2828

the upward pressure on Treasury bill yield rates

which remained broadly stable thereafter until

end September 2018. However, uncertainty

in the financial markets that emanated mainly

from the developments in political and external

spheres, drove the Treasury bill yield rates up at

end October 2018 and the yield rates stabilised

thereafter albeit at relatively higher levels at end

2018. The debt management strategies adopted

during the year in the form of maintaining a stable

and low interest rate environment, especially

during the first three quarters of the year, was

supported by the positive market momentum

created by the expectation on accessing the

international capital market, smoothening the

Treasury bills reissuance process, adherence

to the pre-announced auction calendar for

Treasury bills and Treasury bonds and the

continuous dialogue with market participants

on future arrangements and macroeconomic

developments. Further, Sri Lanka successfully

accessed the international capital markets by

issuing International Sovereign Bonds in April 2018

for US dollars 2,500 million. However, withdrawal

of foreign investments from emerging market

economies, including Sri Lanka, mainly due to

normalisation of interest rates in the USA and the

challenging domestic as well as global economic

conditions that prevailed towards the latter part of

the year not only contributed to an upward pressure

on the yield structure of government securities but

also resulted in reduced foreign holdings of Treasury

bills and Treasury bonds at end 2018 compared to

end 2017. Accordingly, the benchmark yield rate of

364-day Treasury bills recorded an increase of 230

bps at end 2018 compared to end 2017. Further,

the yield rates for 91-day, 182-day and 364-day

maturity Treasury bills stood at 10.01 per cent,

9.99 per cent and 11.20 per cent, respectively, at

end 2018. Moreover, the upward adjustment in

short-term interest rates was also reflected in

medium term Treasury bond yield rates during the

latter part of 2018.

Total net outflow of foreign investments in

Treasury bonds and Treasury bills amounted to

US dollars 990.7 million which consisted of net

outflow of US dollars 96.4 million in Treasury

bills and US dollars 893.6 million in Treasury

bonds during the year 2018. The outstanding

foreign holdings of Treasury bonds and Treasury

bills at end 2018 amounted to Rs. 158.6 billion

compared to Rs. 322.6 billion at end 2017, recording

a noteworthy decrease of 50.8 per cent.

The Central Bank raised US dollars 1,492.1

million by issuing Sri Lanka Development Bonds

(SLDBs) during 2018 against the maturing

amount of US dollars 2,304.2 million, in order

to gain advantage of the market conditions.

This eased the pressure on domestic rupee market

financing and enabled to maintain orderly domestic

interest rates during first three quarters of 2018.

During 2018, the Average Time to Maturity

(ATM) of the overall domestic public debt

portfolio increased and recorded 5.91 years at

end 2018 compared to 5.78 years at end 2017. The

ATM of outstanding Treasury bond portfolio at end

2018 increased to 6.88 years from 6.72 years at end

2017. The upward adjustment in ATM is attributed

to issuance of longer term maturities of Treasury

bonds under the conducive market environment

prevailed mainly in the first half of 2018.

Corporate Debt Securities Market

The level of activity in the commercial paper

(CPs) market continued to remain low. There

was a total of 6 issues with the support of banks

amounting to Rs. 1.9 billion in 2018 compared to 15

issues worth Rs. 6.5 billion in 2017. Interest rates

of the CPs fluctuated between the relatively lower

range of 13.10 to 15.00 per cent in 2018 compared

to the range of 13.75 to 16.50 per cent recorded

in the previous year. All CPs issued in 2018 had a

maturity of 3 months or less. The total outstanding

value of CPs amounted to Rs. 1.2 billion at end

2018 compared with Rs. 1.7 billion at end 2017.

The corporate bond market was relatively

active in 2018 compared to the previous

year. During 2018, There were eleven issues of

debentures which raised Rs. 55.9 billion compared

to five issues totaling Rs. 20.0 billion in 2017. With the

new Basel III requirement, majority of banks raised

capital through Basel III compliant debentures which

boosted activities of the cooperate debt market in

2018. Out of the eleven institutions listed during

the period, eight institutions were banks or other

financial institutions. The highest listed corporate

debt issuance recorded in 2018 amounting to

Rs. 10.0 billion was issued by Commercial Bank

of Ceylon PLC and the second largest issuance of

Rs. 7.5 billion was by Sampath Bank PLC. Among

the debenture issuance, there were one floating

rate debenture and one zero coupon debenture

during the period. The fixed interest rates applicable

to bonds issued in 2018 were in the range of 12.00

– 14.75 per cent, compared to the range of 11.95 –

15.00 per cent in 2017.

Equity Market

The Colombo Stock Exchange recorded a

declining trend in 2018 reversing the growth

achieved in 2017. The All Share Price Index (ASPI)

and the S&P Sri Lanka 20 Index of the Colombo

Stock Exchange declined in 2018 responding

to the adverse developments in the domestic

and global environment. The ASPI decreased

by 5.0 per cent to 6,052.4 at end 2018, which is

comparatively worse than the 2.3 per cent increase

recorded in the previous year. The ASPI reached

5,761.1 in October 2018, its lowest during the year

recording a decrease of 9.6 per cent. The ASPI

showed relatively lower decrement than the overall

equity market indices of most Asian countries

such as China, Japan, South Korea, Hong-Kong,

Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand mainly due to

the size and limited exposure to the global market.

However, India’s equity market indices recorded a

lesser decline than Sri Lanka’s ASPI. Meanwhile,

S&P SL20 index decreased by 14.6 per cent during

2018 compared to the increase of 5.0 per cent

recorded in 2017.

The market recorded a negative development

in terms of turnover, capitalisation and Price to

Earning (PE) ratio. The average daily turnover

was declined to Rs. 833.6 million during 2018,

when compared to Rs. 915.3 million in 2017. The

market capitalization and the number of companies

listed remained low. In 2018, the turnover velocity

(the ratio of total turnover to average market

capitalisation) decreased to 6.9 per cent from

7.5 per cent in 2017. Lower turnover velocity implies

high cost of trading, low investor participation

levels and lower liquidity. Meanwhile, market

capitalisation declined to Rs. 2,839.5 billion at end

2018 from Rs. 2,899.3 billion recorded at end 2017.

Market capitalisation at end 2018 was equivalent

to 21.4 per cent of GDP which was lower than the

24.5 per cent recorded in 2017. The market PE

was relatively lower at 9.7 at end 2018 compared

to 10.6 at end December 2017. During the year, the

ratio reached its highest value of 11.5 in April 2018

and the lowest of 9.0 in October 2018.

Continued foreign outflows from the CSE

was witnessed during 2018. In the secondary

market, the market recorded a net foreign outflow

of Rs. 23.1 billion at end 2018 compared to the

net foreign inflow of Rs.17.7 billion at end 2017.

Net foreign outflows prevailed in the market

during the recent past were mainly driven by the

increased pressure on the exchange rate, political

uncertainty and the shift in investor sentiments

due to global developments. In addition, lack

of diversified investment opportunities has also

negatively affected foreign investments in the

CSE. Foreign investors contribution to total market

turnover declined marginally to 44.3 per cent in

2018 compared to 46.9 per cent recorded during

2017.

The primary market remained less active.

There were two Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2018

which raised Rs. 2.0 billion while one IPO raised 1.0

billion in 2017. Further, Rs. 42.2 billon was raised

through 16 rights issues in 2018 while Rs. 50.6

billion was raised through 15 right issues in 2017.

Price indices of most sub sectors showed

a weaker performance in 2018 compared to

the previous year. Construction and Engineering

(-40.9 per cent), Manufacturing (-27.7 per cent),

Information Technology (-25.9 per cent), Plantations

(-24.5 per cent), Telecommunication (-20.9 per cent)

and Trading (-20.2 per cent) sectors recorded a

substantial decline. Among the 20 sub sectors,

only two sectors recorded a growth during the year,

namely: Stores & Supplies and Beverage and Food

& Tobacco which increased by 3.1 per cent and

5.3 per cent respectively during the year.

During 2018, several regulatory measures

were introduced to improve the smooth

functioning of the equity market. The Securities

and Exchange Commission (SEC) established a

cross divisional committee to review the comments

received from the stakeholders to the Securities

Exchange Bill published in the Gazette in

November 2017. In addition, SEC had conducted

discussions with the delegates from the World

Bank on some of the issues highlighted. Further,

the SEC enforced rules on minimum public holding

requirement and procedures on listed public

companies violating listing requirements of CSE,

to facilitate the conduct of stock market activity in a

healthier manner. A Small and Medium Enterprise

(SME) board was launched facilitating SMEs to

raise capital via CSE.

8.5 Development Finance and Access to Finance

The development finance policy strategies of

the Central Bank focused mainly on enhancing

inclusive and balanced economic growth through

effective credit delivery and financial inclusion in

the country. To achieve the aforesaid objective, the

Central Bank continued to coordinate, facilitate and

implement various refinance, interest subsidy and

credit guarantee schemes, while providing a range

of credit supplementary services to the individuals

and the Micro, Small and Medium Scale Enterprises

(MSMEs) scattered across the country.

In 2018, the Central Bank implemented

various credit schemes, with the funding from

the Central Bank, the government, international

donor agencies and Participating Financial

Institutions (PFIs). Accordingly, the Central

Bank implemented 11 refinance, interest subsidy

and credit guarantee schemes through the

Regional Development Department (RDD) and

provided concessionary credit facilities amounting

to Rs. 16,435.4 million through PFIs to 105,874

beneficiaries island-wide. Meanwhile, the Poverty

Alleviation Microfinance Project II – Revolving

Fund (PAMP II - RF) was successfully completed

in July 2018 as scheduled.

In 2018, the government together with the

International Fund for Agricultural Development

(IFAD) established the Smallholder Agribusiness

Partnership Programme (SAPP) under the

Public-Private-Producer Partnerships (4Ps)

model to develop value chain partnerships and

to improve outcomes for all engaged parties.

The RDD implements the Credit Component of

the SAPP loan schemes whereas the Project

Management Unit (PMU) of SAPP implements

the programme under the Presidential Secretariat

which acts as the Lead Programme Agency of the

SAPP. The SAAP will be funded by both IFAD and

the government. Accordingly, in March 2018, an

Administrative Agreement was signed between the

government and IFAD for the implementation of

the SAPP and in April 2018, operating instructions

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

2868

were issued to PFIs to introduce six new loan

schemes under the SAPP. The loan proceeds for

credit provided by the IFAD is utilised for financing

Public-Private-Producer Partnerships (4Ps) Capital,

4P Seasonal and Youth Loan Schemes. The

government is providing counterpart financing for

SAPP to implement Revolving Fund Loan Schemes

(RF Loan Schemes) of SAPP, namely, RF Capital,

RF Seasonal and RF Income Generation Scheme.

In this regard, the government established a

Consolidated Revolving Fund (CRF) under the

SAPP, utilizing the recoveries of the previous IFAD

funded financial lines of credits, namely, Dry Zone

Livelihood Support and Partnership Programme

– Revolving Fund (DZLiSPP-RF), Smallholder

Plantation and Entrepreneurship Development

Programme (SPEnDP) and National Agribusiness

Development Project (NADeP). The CRF is utilised

for all the previous and present IFAD funded project

beneficiaries to meet their financing requirements

under RF Loan Schemes. Further, responding to

the needs of the farmers who engage in seasonal

agricultural activities, maximum repayment period

and the grace period were increased to 30 months

and 18 months respectively from 12 months and 6

months respectively, in December 2018 in relation

to Seasonal Loans of SAPP. In October 2018,

a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was

signed with the PMU of the SAPP to develop an

automation system to automate the operations of

the loan schemes implemented by RDD under the

SAPP loan schemes.

During 2018, the government contributed to

further improve the development finance and

access to finance in the country through the

“Enterprise Sri Lanka” (ESL) Programme. The

Ministry of Finance and Mass Media (MoF&MM)

introduced 15 loan schemes under the programme.

The ESL programme was introduced with the

objective of making all Sri Lankans as stakeholders

in a production economy to achieve the

government’s medium-term development targets of

increasing the per capita income up to US dollars

5,000, creation of one million new employment

opportunities, doubling of exports and sustaining

economic growth over 5 per cent by 2020. Through

this programme, the government has expected

to improve the agriculture, industry and services

sectors in the country by providing concessionary

financial and non-financial assistance to youth,

women and the MSMEs identified as the driving

force of the economic development.

Total loans granted under the ESL

programme increased significantly in 2018, the

first full year of operations compared to nine

months of the previous year. The total number

of loans registered under the ESL programme in

2018 increased to 34,476 and the value of loans

granted amounted to Rs. 65,364 million compared

to 6,460 of registered loans and Rs. 16,381 million

worth of loans granted during the previous year.

Out of the total loans provided in 2018, a majority of

51.4 per cent (42 per cent of the total no. of loans)

has been disbursed in 6 districts (i.e. Gampaha,

Colombo, Kurunegala, Kalutara, Hambantota

and Galle) whilst the balance 48.6 per cent

(58 per cent of the total no. of loans) was granted

in 19 districts which indicates the need for more

focus on lending to the lagging districts under the

programme. In 2018, it was further observed that,

out of the total value of the loans, 30.4 per cent

has been disbursed to manufacturing industries,

26 per cent to the agriculture sector and

20.2 per cent to the tourism industry. Further, it

was proposed to introduce a Credit Guarantee

Scheme (CGS) in 2018, to provide government

guarantees through the Central Bank to the PFIs

for the loans granted under “Ran Aswenna”, “Govi

Navoda”, “Jaya Isura”, “Diri Saviya” and “Green

Loan” loan schemes of the ESL programme.

The CGS is considered as a risk sharing tool for

loans granted under the above schemes which

operate with a view to developing the MSMEs in

Sri Lanka. Accordingly, an agreement to this effect

was signed between the MoF&MM and the Central

Bank in January 2019.

During 2018, the Ministry of Industry &

Commerce and Resettlement of Protracted

Displaced Person and Cooperative Development

continued the “Small and Micro Industry Leader

and Entrepreneur Promotion Project Phase III

– Revolving Fund (SMILE III - RF)” to provide

concessionary funding for the micro or small-

scale manufacturing or industrial enterprises.

These low interest rate loans were granted to

establish new enterprises or to enhance productivity

or the level of operations, improve the quality of

products offered, improvement of organisational

capacity and product development by existing

enterprises. Loans were granted under two main

loan schemes, namely the “General Loan Scheme”

and the “Technical Transfer Assistance Loan

Scheme”. In addition to the above organisations

that implemented refinance and interest subsidy

loan schemes and other related support services,

several other governmental and non-governmental

institutions too carried out operations with a view

to enhance development finance and access to

finance throughout the country. The efforts of those

institutions lead to improvements in access to

finance and financial inclusiveness in the country.

The Central Bank continued its drive towards

the establishment of a National Financial

Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) on the foundation

laid down in the previous year. Accordingly,

an agreement of Cooperation was signed with

International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member

of World Bank Group in January 2018 to acquire

technical assistance to develop NFIS for Sri Lanka.

Four potential policy pillars have been identified and

four working groups/committees were formed on

the areas of Digital Finance and Payments, MSME

Finance, Consumer Protection and Financial

Literacy & Capacity Building. Meanwhile, the

RDD with the assistance of IFC initiated actions to

conduct a Financial Inclusion Survey to understand

the overview and general landscape for financial

inclusion levels across the country, under the

NFIS project. The financial inclusion survey was

conducted island wide covering 480 Grama Niladari

Divisions in all districts through a dedicated survey

firm selected for this purpose. NFIS would serve

to deepen and accelerate national efforts to reach

higher levels of financial inclusion in the future.

The Central Bank continued to conduct

awareness programmes and workshops

to promote financial literacy, financial

inclusiveness and entrepreneurship

development among the different stakeholder

groups and rural communities. During the year,

the Central Bank conducted 154 programmes on

financial literacy, entrepreneurship development

and skills development with special focus on those

who have no access to the formal financial sector.

These programmes were attended by school

leavers, government officials, farmers and new and

existing entrepreneurs.

8.6 Financial Infrastructure

Payment and Settlement Systems

The Central Bank continued to ensure

safe and efficient payment and settlement

infrastructure in the country in order to cater

to the payment needs of the individuals and

institutions and to effectively facilitate the

economic activities of the country. As the

regulator of the national payment system, the

Central Bank further broadened the regulatory and

supervisory activities with the objective of ensuring

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

2888

the stability and soundness of the financial system

by effectively mitigating the risks associated with

payment and settlement systems.

The LankaSettle System comprises of the Real

Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System, which is

the only large-value electronic payment system in

the country, and the LankaSecure System, which

is the scripless government securities settlement

system. During the year under review, RTGS System

settled 405,200 transactions registering an increase of

7.39 per cent, while the aggregate value of RTGS

transactions amounted to Rs. 100,473.1 billion

recording an increase of 8.85 per cent when

compared with the previous year. In value terms,

the share of RTGS transactions in total non-cash

payments accounted for 86.3 per cent in 2018.

The Central Bank continued to provide the Intra-

day Liquidity Facility (ILF) to the participating

institutions of the RTGS System to minimise the

liquidity risk of the system. The daily average

value of the ILF utilised by the RTGS participants

during the year amounted to Rs. 55 billion. At end

2018, the total value of scripless securities held in

the LankaSecure amounted to Rs. 5,103 billion

(Face Value) consisting of Treasury bills of Rs.758.8

billion and Treasury bonds of Rs 4,344.2 billion.

The Cheque Clearing System of the country

operated by LankaClear (Pvt.) Ltd. (LCPL)

functioned smoothly during the year under

review. Aggregate volume of cheques cleared

through the Cheque Clearing System accounted

for 20.5 per cent of the total volume of non-cash

payments of the country during 2018. When

compared with 2017, the total volume of cheques

cleared through the Cheque Clearing System

recorded a negative growth of 3.10 per cent while

the aggregate value of cheques cleared grew

marginally by 0.44 per cent in 2018.

During 2018, the Sri Lanka Inter-bank

Payment System (SLIPS) which mainly

facilitates retail bulk payments such as salaries

continued to operate smoothly. The operations

of SLIPS recorded a growing trend with both the

volume and value of payments processed through

the system increasing over the previous year. The

volume and value of the payments effected through

SLIPS grew by 9.75 per cent to 33 million and by

14.33 per cent to Rs. 1,972 billion respectively.

The Common Card and Payment Switch

(CCAPS) which functions under the brand

name “LankaPay” recorded a noteworthy

progress in 2018 with the increased transaction

volumes in the three sub-switches launched

so far, namely the Common ATM Switch

(CAS), Common Electronic Fund Transfer

Switch (CEFTS) and Shared ATM Switch

(SAS). CAS, which connects ATMs of member

financial institutions, enables customers of such

financial institutions to perform cash withdrawals

and balance inquiries from any ATM connected

to the CAS network. In 2018, the transaction

volume and value of CAS increased by 22.9 per

cent to 40.5 million and 30.5 per cent to Rs. 344.6

billion respectively, in comparison to the previous

year. At the end of the review period, the total

number of financial institutions connected to

Modernisation of the national payment system

Sri Lanka has been a forerunner in introducing electronic payment systems to its economy and remains comparable with many developed Asian and Western economies. The national payment system1 has been designed with the flexibility to evolve and facilitate the dynamic payment needs of the economy. With the aim of gradually transitioning into a digitalised economy, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) began modernising the national payment system in 2002.

As an initial step of the modernisation programme, legislative changes were introduced recognising the importance of payment and settlement systems for a modern economy. Accordingly, the Monetary Law Act, No. 58 of 1949 (as amended) (MLA) was amended in 2002 establishing the intrinsic relationship between the monetary, financial and payment systems to achieve economic and price stability, and financial system stability. The CBSL was thereby made the authority responsible for the administration, regulation and supervision of payment systems in Sri Lanka and was given broad powers to fulfill this responsibility. Dedicated legislation was introduced by way of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, No. 28 of 2005 (PSSA). The PSSA provided the framework for the regulation, supervision and monitoring of payment, clearing and settlement systems, money services, and to facilitate electronic presentment of cheques. Further, it enabled the development of new payment methods and technologies, and advancing cooperation among all participants in the evolution of payment systems. The PSSA provided the CBSL with powers to ensure that payment services operating in Sri Lanka were safe and sound. The legislative changes also enabled the CBSL to divest its payment and clearing activities to LankaClear (Pvt) Limited (LCPL), which is jointly owned by the CBSL and licensed commercial banks.

1 A “payment system” consists of a set of instruments, banking procedures and, typi-cally, interbank funds transfer systems that ensure the circulation of money (Commit-tee on Payment and Settlement Systems, 2003). Payment systems include i) payment instruments; ii) payment infrastructure (clearing and settlement mechanisms); iii) other ancillary services (market players and institutional structure); iv) oversight and super-visory arrangements; and v) the legal and regulatory framework (Jayamaha, 2014 p. 5). The national payment system comprises both centralised systems that interlink stake-holders, such as the CBSL, licensed banks, non-bank financial institutions, card net-works and mobile operators, as well as proprietary systems that are independently operated by stakeholders.

BOX 11Evolution of the National Payment System of Sri Lanka

Major electronic payment, clearing and settlement systems in Sri Lanka

Settlement infrastructure

The Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System, which is owned and operated by the CBSL, was introduced in 2003, for real-time settlement of large value fund transfers through the banking system on gross basis. Prior to the RTGS System, all interbank payments were settled on deferred-net settlement basis. Under the RTGS process, participants must maintain sufficient funds in their accounts with the CBSL to enable real-time settlement. As a measure of mitigating liquidity risk of the RTGS System, the CBSL provides the Intraday Liquidity Facility (ILF) to participants who experience liquidity issues during the day. The RTGS System is designated as a Systemically Important Payment System (SIPS). The growth of the economy has increased the demand for real-time settlement of large value fund transfers, making the RTGS System a vital payment infrastructure in Sri Lanka.

Major interbank payment and clearing systems

Sri Lanka’s journey in electronic interbank systems began with the introduction of the Sri Lanka Interbank Payment System (SLIPS) in 1994, as an offline electronic fund transfer system. SLIPS automated periodic and bulk payments, such as salaries and utility bill payments, replacing the manual process of issuing cheques for payments. There are two main types of SLIPS payments – credit transfers and direct debit. SLIPS was upgraded to an online system in 2010, resulting in the settlement period being shortened to T+0 (same day but not real-time). SLIPS remained the only electronic interbank payment system in Sri Lanka, until the launch of the RTGS System in 2003.

The Cheque Imaging and Truncation System (CITS) was launched in 2006 and has also been designated as a SIPS. Sri Lanka is a relatively early adopter of a cheque imaging and truncation system, in comparison to leading economies.2 This system reduced cheque realisation time from 5-7 days to next-day (T+1) realisation as cheques were cleared by LCPL using cheque images that were electronically transferred by banks.

2 Examples of economies that implemented cheque imaging and truncation systems: New Zealand – 1995; USA – 2004; India – 2008; UK- 2017 (Sources: respective Central Bank websites).

National Payment Switch

The launch of the Common Card and Payment Switch (CCAPS), in 2013, marked a key milestone in the evolution of Sri Lanka’s electronic retail payment infrastructure. CCAPS is a multi-switch facility that comprises five sub switches, i.e., Common ATM Switch (CAS), Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch (CEFTS), Shared ATM Switch (SAS), Common POS Switch (CPS) and Common Mobile Switch (CMobS). CCAPS has been designated as the “National Payment Switch” and is operated by LCPL under the brand name of ‘LankaPay’. CCAPS is being launched in phases, of which three phases have already been completed.

CAS, which is the first phase of CCAPS, started live operations in July 2013. It integrated the country’s ATM infrastructure enabling ATM cardholders to use any ATM machine in the LankaPay network. SAS allows banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) that are unable to invest in their own ATM switches or card management systems to link to the CAS switch at a low cost via LankaPay. SAS extends ATM facilities to customers of such financial institutions.

The introduction of CEFTS, in 2015, has revolutionised the retail payment system of Sri Lanka. CEFTS created immense opportunities for payment innovations as it facilitates interbank real-time fund transfers using Internet and mobile banking, ATM and over-the-counter channels. Its versatility has made CEFTS the basis for several payment infrastructure innovations in Sri Lanka.

The LankaPay Online Payment Platform (LPOPP), which was introduced in 2017, enabled online real-time payments to government institutions using CEFTS. LPOPP was introduced to streamline government revenue collection. Accordingly, Sri Lanka Customs was the first institution to utilise LPOPP for payments. Subsequently, approval was granted by the CBSL to integrate four more government institutions to LPOPP. As at 31 December 2018, eight licensed commercial banks have connected to LPOPP.

JustPay, which was launched in 2017, is a key infrastructure innovation that supports mobile based FinTech innovations, such as mobile applications, to securely link to banking networks. It facilitates low value payments directly from customer accounts using the CEFTS direct debit facility.

The regulatory framework required to implement the fourth phase of CCAPS, CPS, is in place to facilitate the switching and clearing of transactions under the

National Card Scheme (NCS). CMobS will enable interoperability between e-money wallets and support wallet-to-wallet transfer.

Payment cards and e-money

Sri Lanka has several other retail payment methods, such as payment cards and e-money. These are proprietary systems that are regulated through the PSSA and other laws related to the banking industry to ensure their safety and soundness in order to achieve financial system stability. There are two mobile network operators that are licensed to provide e-money services in Sri Lanka.

LCPL, under the guidance and supervision of the CBSL, has entered into a strategic partnership with the international payment card network JCB (Japan Credit Bureau) to establish the NCS. The NCS will enable banks and financial institutions to issue LankaPay-JCB co-branded debit cards that will be processed locally through LankaPay’s CAS and CPS networks, and internationally through the JCB network. The main objective of the NCS project is to reduce the cost of card transactions to all stakeholders, i.e., cardholders, merchants, issuers and acquirers, by domestically routing card payments.

QR Code based payments

Responding to the need for ubiquitous digital payment methods and real-time settlement of retail payments, the CBSL introduced the LANKAQR code standard in 2018. This standard is based on the “EMV QR Code Specification for Payment Systems”, which facilitates the interoperability of different payment mechanisms and eliminates the need to have multiple QR codes. By adopting the LANKAQR code, financial institutions will be able to provide customers and merchants access to low-cost digital payments and to increase customer convenience.

Way forward

The CBSL has been promoting digital payment systems to meet the needs of a less-cash society and continuously works with the industry to create an environment that advances the use of new technologies. Accordingly, inter-industry collaborations to implement FinTech solutions such as the National Transit Card and Open Application Programming Interface (Open API) platforms are among new priorities undertaken. Further, the CBSL has begun working closely with relevant stakeholders to explore the feasibility of adopting Blockchain Technology in

In October 2018, the number of clearing

cycles per business day for CAS and CEFTS

were increased from two to four in order to

enable faster clearing and settlement of CAS

and CEFTS transactions. In addition, the Central

Bank imposed the minimum liability limits in CAS

and CEFTS for primary participants in order to

ensure smooth operations of these systems.

With a view to reduce costs incurred by

cardholders and merchants on domestic

payment card transactions, the Central Bank

granted approval for LCPL to implement a

National Card Scheme (NCS). NCS was launched

in 2018 with one licensed commercial bank starting

to issue ATM cards under NCS. In order to facilitate

routing of transactions carried out using a payment

card issued under NCS, the Central Bank monitored

the progress of licensed financial acquirers joining

the Common Point-of-Sales Switch.

The Central Bank continued its regulatory

and supervisory activities with regard to

payment cards and mobile payment systems in

terms of the provisions of the Payment Cards

and Mobile Payment Systems Regulations No. 1

of 2013. Accordingly, two financial institutions

which were licensed to function as issuers of debit

cards were granted approval to function as issuers

of credit cards while another financial institution was

granted a licence to function as a financial acquirer

of payment cards, in terms of the Regulations.

the CAS network was recorded as 28. SAS, which

was launched in 2015 to provide card management

and ATM transaction routing services to financial

institutions which do not have the capacity to

operate their own card management system,

had two members and continued its operations

smoothly during the review period.

CEFTS, the second phase of CCAPS, was

launched in 2015 to facilitate real time retail

fund transfers among member institutions.

In comparison to the previous year, the CEFTS

transaction volume increased remarkably by

128.7 per cent to 7.2 million while the CEFTS

transaction value grew by 141.2 per cent to

Rs. 660.3 billion in 2018, recording a noteworthy

progress in CEFTS transactions. Meanwhile,

as per the approval granted by the Central Bank

to facilitate online payments to governmental

institutions, LCPL launched the LankaPay Online

Payment Platform (LPOPP) initially to facilitate

online real time payments to Sri Lanka Customs.

At end of 2018, eight licensed commercial banks

have joined LPOPP to provide real time payment

facilities and during 2018 15,431 transactions

with an aggregate value of Rs. 12 billion were

processed through LPOPP. In 2018, the Central

Bank granted approval to LCPL to connect with

three other governmental institutions to provide

online real time payment facilities.

areas such as Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes and trade finance to improve the safety and efficiency of financial services. In order to adopt virtual banking and e-KYC processes, CBSL is evaluating the possibility of integrating with the national e-NIC (Electronic National Identity Card) initiative of the Department for Registration of Persons. This will enable the introduction of many FinTech innovations that require digital means of identity verification as well as increase access to finance by reducing onboarding costs. While adopting new technologies, the CBSL is also highly aware of the risks of data sharing. Therefore, the CBSL has strengthened its regulatory framework to ensure the safety of customer funds and information. Further, the

CBSL is collaborating with relevant national agencies to develop a strong legislative framework on Data Protection for Sri Lanka. With these proactive measures, it is expected that the national payment system of Sri Lanka will continue to cater to the evolving payment needs of a digitalised economy.

The Central Bank, continued its supervisory

function and further strengthened the regulatory

framework in order to minimise the risks in the

national payment and settlement system. In 2018,

the Central Bank continued supervisory activities to

minimise the risks associated with payment cards

and mobile payment systems. Accordingly, on-site

and off-site supervision was carried out to ensure

compliance with the regulations by Service Providers

of Payment Cards and Mobile Payment Systems.

In addition, taking the payment system

developments into consideration, the Central

Bank broadened its regulatory framework

in 2018 by issuing regulations on acquiring

payment card based electronic commerce

transactions through service providers and

on payment related mobile applications.

Considering the risk in the involvement of third

party payment platform providers in e-commerce

transactions, the Direction on Acquiring Payment

Card based Electronic Commerce Transactions

through Service Providers was issued on 18 January

2018 to stipulate conditions on acquiring payment

card based transactions through payment platform

providers. The Central Bank issued the Guidelines

on Minimum Compliance Standard for Payment

Related Mobile Applications in January 2018 to

set minimum compliance standards for Mobile

Applications used by Financial Institutions.

Having considered the global trend in

adopting new technologies for the development

of payment and settlement systems, the

National Payments Council, the consultative

committee on payment and settlement

systems, appointed two committees to study

developments in the financial technology

(FinTech) sector and Blockchain technology.

As per the recommendations made by the

Fintech Committee, PSD issued the Payment

and Settlement Systems Circular No. 06 of 2018

to establish the National Quick Response (QR)

Code Standard for Local Payments. In addition,

as per another recommendation made by the

FinTech Committee, initiated actions to establish

a FinTech Regulatory Sandbox to provide an

environment that supports and promotes the

financial technology innovations in the country

while maintaining appropriate regulatory

standards. The working committee appointed

as per the recommendation of the Committee

on Blockchain Technology to further study the

adoption of blockchain technology in the financial

sector is evaluating the feasibility of a shared

KYC blockchain solution to be used in the banking

sector.

The Central Bank plans to establish a state-

of-the-art financial market infrastructure and

the enabling legal and regulatory framework

in Sri Lanka, based on international standards

and best practices to address the inherent

limitations of the existing trading and

settlement systems for domestic financial

market transactions. An Electronic Trading

Platform (ETP), a Central Counterparty clearing

and settlement system (CCP) and a Central

Securities Depository (CSD) system to facilitate

electronic trading and straight-through processing

(STP) of transactions in the domestic financial

market, with emphasis to government securities

and foreign exchange transactions are proposed

to be established under this system. In line with

this proposal, new IT infrastructure on ETP and

CCP are to be introduced to facilitate transparent

and efficient primary and secondary market

operations in government securities transactions,

which is vital for the development of government

securities market and modernization of the public

debt management.

Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism

Money laundering and Terrorist financing

can influence the stability of the financial

system. The Financial Intelligence Unit of Sri

Lanka (FIU), established under the statutory

provisions of the Financial Transactions Reporting

Act, No. 6 of 2006 (FTRA) continued to strengthen

the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the

Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime of the

country to preserve the stability of the financial

system. During 2018, the FIU performed the role

of receiving financial information relating to Money

Laundering/Terrorist Financing (ML/TF) including

Suspicious Transactions Reports (STRs),

analyzing and disseminating analytic results to

the law enforcement agencies, regulators and

other relevant entities where necessary. Further

during the year, the FIU with the coordination of

other stakeholders actively engaged in working

towards successful completion of the time bound

action plan provided to Sri Lanka to address the

strategic deficiencies identified in the AML/CFT

activities by Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

FATF is the global standard setter in AML/CFT

activities.

During the year FIU received 1,022 STRs

from reporting institutions, law enforcement

agencies and general public and after analysis

and assessment a total of 317 STRs was

referred to the law enforcement and regulatory

authorities for further investigations.

Reporting institutions also continued to report

Cash Transactions (CTRs) and Electronic Fund

Transfers (EFTs -Inward and outwards) exceeding

the threshold of Rs. 1.0 million or its equivalent

in foreign currencies as per Section 6 of the

FTRA. During the period, reporting institutions

have reported 5.6 million CTRs and 6.3 mn EFTs

respectively.

Compliance Monitoring and Legislative Developments

Compliance with the AML/CFT framework

of the country is essential for the prevention

of money laundering, terrorist financing

and connected financial crimes which

could threaten the stability of domestic

as well as global economic and financial

systems. During the year, 19 risk based

onsite examinations were conducted to assess

financial institutions' compliance with the FTRA

and rules and regulations issued thereunder.

Furthermore, during the year the FIU issued

guidelines on Suspicious Transactions

Reporting, Money Laundering and Terrorist

Financing Risk Management and Identification

of Beneficial Ownership for financial institutors

to strengthen the AML/CTF supervision process

and institutional compliance.

With the issuance of Designated Non-

Finance Business (Customer Due Diligence)

Rules, No. 1 of 2018 in January 2018 the FIU

expanded its assessment of institutional

compliance to the designated non-financial

businesses and professions (DNFBPs).

Accordingly, the FIU conducted 27 progress

review visits to the DNFBPs which were recognised

as high risk sectors for money laundering, to

examine the effective implementation of the

AML/CFT measures. During the year the FIU

took measures to strengthen the institutional

compliance of DNFBPs by issuing sector specific

Guidelines on AML/CFT Compliance Obligations.

During the 2018 the FIU entered into two

Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with

the Insurance Regulatory Commission of

Sri Lanka and the Securities and Exchange

Commission of Sri Lanka which are regulatory

and supervisory body of the Insurance Sector

and Securities Sector respectively to establish

Overview

Although globalisation, powered by advancement in technology, has accelerated economic growth and development of countries, it has introduced new dangers to the global economy. Money Laundering (ML) and Terrorist Financing (TF) have been identified as two such major dangers. If there is a healthy global financial system within which there are no loopholes to inject proceeds derived from illegal activities or to channel funds for terrorist activities, the benefits of globalisation can be assured and reaped at an optimal level. Money launderers and terrorist financiers exploit the weak and ineffective controls in some countries and enter and eventually damage the global financial system. Therefore, strong anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regimes at country level are required to protect the international financial system. With the understanding of this requirement, the Financial Action Task Force1 has set global standards in preventing ML/TF. At the beginning, these standards were more focused on finance businesses such as banks, financial institutions, lending institutions and money and currency changing services as they are usually more attractive for ML/TF. However, the scope was gradually expanded to designated non-finance businesses and professions (DNFBPs)2 with the recognition of their high potentiality of being used by money launderers and terrorist financiers. Records have shown that DNFBPs constitute an increasing ML/TF threat in the Sri Lankan context too.3 Therefore, these global standards were introduced for Sri Lankan non-finance businesses and professions under the legal enactment of Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006 (FTRA).

Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing through DNFBPs

Money launderers and terrorist financiers always search for channels through which they can transfer criminal proceeds and terrorist funds to conceal their illicit origins. DNFBP sector has become attractive for money launderers and terrorist financiers mainly due to non-availability of proper controls, policies or procedures to mitigate such risks. In particularly, a majority of DNFBPs are unaware of AML/CFT requirements or do

1 FATF is the inter-governmental body which was setup as the global policy setter against ML & TF in 1989. The global standards issued by the FATF are commonly called as ‘Recommendations’ for combatting of ML/TF and Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (PWMD) (www.fatf-gafi.org). At present, there are 40 such Recommendations against ML, TF and PWMD that every country should comply with.

2 DNFBPs include casinos, gambling houses or conducting of a lottery, real estate agents, dealers in precious metals and dealers in precious and semi-precious stones, lawyers, notaries, accountants and trusts or company service providers among others.

not willingly contribute to implement them. Also, it is very difficult to assess the ways and means being used for ML/TF since they are evolving with the advancement in technology, such as transferring funds using wire transfers and online payment facilities.

Conversion of illegal money into legal money can be done through DNFBPs in many ways. For example, real estate transactions can be misused for ML/TF purposes in various ways such as investing illegally earned money (e.g. drug proceeds) for buying properties and reselling them to further conceal the illegal origin of the money or to make complex the audit trails, purchasing properties for expansion of illegal or terrorist activities, making initial deposits for properties using illicit money and then requesting for a refund to a given bank account to enter the illicit funds to the formal financial system, etc. Further, money launderers and terrorist financiers prefer to invest in commodities such as gold, gems and jewellery due to possibility of investing a large amount of money in small items which can be carried easily between countries as personal belongings. Also, they may use gambling websites and virtual gaming sites to convert their ill-gotten money to legal money. Further, professionals like accountants, lawyers, notaries and company service providers can be used for money laundering and terrorist financing with or without their knowledge. Professional service providers are referred to as “Gate Keepers” in the money laundering context, as these professionals’ goodwill is used by money launderers to hide themselves in the money laundering process.

Regulatory Framework and AML/CFT Legal Obligations for DNFBPs in Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka’s AML/CFT framework consists of three pieces of legislation including FTRA and two other legal enactments namely Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, No. 25 of 2005 (CSTF) and Prevention of Money Laundering Act, No. 05 of 2006 (PMLA). The Financial Intelligence Unit of Sri Lanka (FIU-SL) is vested with the regulatory powers under the provisions of the FTRA to implement the AML/CFT legal requirements and such requirements are coordinated through the AML/CFT National Coordinating Committee (NCC), which is chaired by the Governor of the Central Bank.

In terms of the FTRA, person/s (natural/legal person including a body of persons) engaging in or carrying out any Finance Business and Designated Non-Finance Business are required to comply with the provisions of the Act. Among others, casinos, real estate agents, dealers in precious metals and precious stones, lawyers,

notaries, accountants and trusts and company service providers, as defined in Section 33 of the FTRA are being given priority in applying AML/CFT obligations. Considering the FATF recommendations, the FIU-SL has issued rules and guidelines4 for these DNFBPs under the FTRA. Accordingly, the following are the key AML/CFT obligations that should be complied by the DNFBPs in Sri Lanka.

Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Record Keeping

As per FATF Recommendations, Customer Due Diligence measures should be applied as a preventive measure against ML/TF risks. This should be done at the time of establishing a business relationship, carrying out occasional transactions, any suspicion on ML/TF or any doubt on previously obtained identification data of a customer or a beneficial owner.5

Section 2 of the FTRA stipulates the requirement of identifying the customer. As per the CDD rule referred to above, minimum information such as full name, permanent address, occupation, official personal identification number, source of funds and purpose of transaction should be obtained and person’s identity should be verified using a legally valid identification document such as National Identity Card, Passport or driving license. The customer should be then categorised according to the ML/TF risk levels. Further, DNFBPs are required to follow enhanced customer due diligence measures for both customers categorised as “high risk” and for business relationships or transactions where higher risks are involved (Eg. when a customer is a Politically Exposed Person (PEP), or having non-face-to-face business relationships with the customer). Also, CDD is required as specified by law when a customer is a legal person or a legal arrangement.

Apart from the above, it is required to maintain all necessary records on transactions for at least five years as per the FATF Recommendations. However, as required by Section 4 of the FTRA, the specified records should be retained for at least 6 years in a manner which allows data to be retrieved easily and quickly whenever required or requested by the FIU.

Suspicious Transactions Reporting

According to FATF Recommendations, if a DNFBP suspects or has reasonable grounds to suspect that funds are the proceeds of a criminal activity or are related to terrorist financing, it should be required by law, to report its suspicion to the FIU of the country.

Accordingly, Section 7 of the FTRA requires to report suspicious transactions (STRs) immediately to the FIU-SL after forming a suspicion or receiving information related to ML/TF activities, but no later than two working days therefrom. An STR can be submitted by email or telephone and should be followed up in writing within twenty-four hours. Accordingly, the FIU has prescribed the “Suspicious Transactions (Format) Regulations of 2017, where the “Schedule V” of the regulation is for the DNFBPs to report STRs to the FIU. Further, the FIU has provided the DNFBPs with ML/TF suspicion indicators, which are called “Red flags”.

Regulation and Supervision of DNFBPs

In line with FATF Recommendations, there should be a comprehensive regulatory and supervisory regime that ensures the effective implementation of the necessary AML/CFT measures in DNFBPs and they should be subject to effective systems for monitoring and ensuring compliance with AML/CFT requirements in a country.

Accordingly, the FIU-Sri Lanka works as the AML/CFT monitoring body for the DNFBPs of Sri Lanka and applies risk-based approach in monitoring relevant DNFBPs. DNFBPs are required to appoint a Compliance Officer (CO) to implement a risk-based compliance programme at institutional level. The required awareness, training and technical assistance are provided by the FIU. An offsite examination for each DNFBP is conducted against the collected information through the CO and followed by an onsite examination based on the risk categorisation of the offsite examination. Corrective action for non-compliance is initiated by the FIU as per the FTRA. Other Relevant AML/CFT Measures for DNFBPs

In addition to the above, the DNFBPs are required to apply other AML/CFT measures, such as assessing the institution’s ML/TF risk periodically, documenting and implementing AML/CFT policies and procedures, screening customers against the designated persons and entities by the United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs), conducting AML/CFT training for all the relevant employees, screening employees before hiring and conducting an independent audit on institutional AML/CFT framework.

In introducing these measures for the DNFBP sector, the FIU-SL closely works with relevant regulators, licensing bodies, associations and other key institutions such as National Gem and Jewellery Authority, Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellers Association, Condominium Management Authority, Condominium Developers Association, Urban Development Authority, National Housing Development Authority, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri lanka and Bar Association of Sri Lanka.

4 Designated Non-Finance Business (Customer Due Diligence) Rules, No. 01 of 2018, Guidelines on Anti-Money laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism Compliance Obligations for Casinos & Gambling Houses, No.02 of 2018 and Guidelines on Anti-Money laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism Compliance Obligations for Dealers in Real Estate, Precious Metals, Precious & Semi-Precious Stones, No. 03 of 2018.

a framework for sharing information on

supervisory findings based on comprehensive

risk-based supervision focused on AML/CFT in

both sectors. Further, with a view to enhancing

the FIU’s analysis function, an MOU were signed

with the Department of Motor Traffic.

Listing by Financial Action Task Force and Progress made towards Improving Sri Lanka’s AML/CFT Compliance

AML/CFT compliance is regularly monitored

by FATF through its regional bodies such

as Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering

(APG), and mutual evaluations are conducted

for the same. The 2nd Mutual Evaluation (ME)

on Sri Lanka was conducted during 2014/15 by

APG with the intention of assessing Sri Lanka’s

AML/CFT compliance on the international AML/CFT

standards. The Mutual Evaluation Report (MER)

adopted in July 2015 recommended a series of

actions to be implemented by Sri Lanka under

the APG’s “expedite enhanced follow up”

process. In October 2016, the FATF informed

that Sri Lanka will be subject to a review of the

International Cooperation Review Group (ICRG)

of the FATF to assess the progress of AML/

CFT effectiveness. After several discussions

and progress reports, the FATF informed that

Sri Lanka has not made sufficient progress in

four areas, namely International Cooperation,

Supervision, Legal Persons and Arrangements

and Targeted Financial Sanctions on

Proliferations (North Korea & Iran). As a result,

the FATF at its Plenary held at Buenos Aires,

Argentina in October 2017, listed Sri Lanka as a

jurisdiction with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies

in the FATF’s Compliance Document which is

more commonly identified as the “Grey List”.

Upon listing, a time bound action plan to address

the strategic deficiencies identified was provided

to Sri Lanka. Since the listing in November 2017,

Sri Lankan authorities have taken effective and

tangible steps to implement the FATF Action Plan

including passing Trust Ordinance (Amendment)

Act No. 6 of 2018, Mutual Assistance in Criminal

Matters (Amendment) Act No. 24 of 2018, Issue of

regulation/directives/guidelines on implementing

United National Security Council Resolutions on

North Korea and Iran, extending the AML/CFT

coverage to DNFBPs by issuing Customer Due

Diligence Rule, conducting risk based AML/CFT

supervision of the financial and DNFBPs sector,

taking enforcement actions on non-compliances

observed and conducting island wide outreach

Cost of Non-Compliance with International Standards of AML/CFT

Money laundering and terrorist financing pose threats to the stability of the global financial system with their extended impact on economies. Some unfavourable consequences of ML/TF are inequalities in resource allocation, persuading young generation to make easy-money, jeopardising world peace, corrupting legal systems, irrational increases in property prices and damaging the reputation of the country by building up stigma as a high-risk country for financial frauds, etc. Hence, the economic and social cost of such crimes and the possibility of laundering the proceeds of crimes are tremendously high. Therefore, every country should adopt AML/CFT measures in order to ensure that there is deterrence at the country level to prevent integration of illegal or criminal proceeds with legitimate cash flows

of the global financial system. AML/CFT compliance may enhance the reputation of a country among the international community while any failure will ultimately result in economic and political sanctions by the international community and international policymakers. Costs of addressing such deficiencies are also significant as procedures for rectifying them may be cumbersome. Sri Lanka is currently working with a high commitment in implementing international standards of AML/CFT. Therefore, the support of all stakeholders and the general public is required to uplift Sri Lanka’s image as a country with zero tolerance towards ML/TF.

The FATF assessed Sri Lanka’s progress

in implementing the Action Plan through Asia

Pacific Joint Group (AP/JG). Four progress

reports were submitted and face-to-face

discussions were held with the AP/JG on the

progress made by Sri Lanka during January,

May and September 2018 and January 2019

respectively. The AP/JG acknowledged that

Sri Lanka has made significant progress and has

largely addressed the action plan given by the

FATF. Accordingly, it is expected that Sri Lanka

will be able to exit the “Grey List” by mid-2019.

Legal Reforms related to the Financial Sector

With a view to strengthen and enhance the

regulatory and supervisory powers vested

on the Central Bank, several legal reforms

including amendments to the existing laws and

new enactments have been carried out during

the year 2018. As such, amendments on the

Monetary Law Act, No. 58 of 1949, Banking Act,

No. 30 of 1988, Finance Business Act, No. 42 of

2011, Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance,

No. 7 of 1937, and the Payment and Settlement

Systems Act, No. 28 of 2005 have been initiated in

2018. Further, amendments have been proposed

for the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act,

No. 2 of 1990 to enable all the specialised banks

licensed under the Banking Act to benefit from

the expeditious procedures for recovering debt,

and thereby enhancing the efficiency of the

recovery of loans. Furthermore, the Active Liability

Management Act, No. 8 of 2018 to facilitate the legal

framework for active management of the public

debt was enacted during this year. Commencement

of drafting of the “Sharing of Information among

Financial Sector Regulators Bill” in collaboration

with the Legal Draftsman’s Department to facilitate

joint efforts of financial sector regulators to peruse

respective statutory objectives for a stable and

robust financial system in the country, has been

an important milestone that took place during this

year.

Resolution and Enforcement Action on Weak Financial Institutions

The Monetary Board granted approval to

cancel the licences issued to two distressed

member institutions namely Central Investments

and Finance PLC (CIFL) and the Standard Credit

Finance Ltd (TSCFL) with effect from 05 March

2018 and 25 July 2018 respectively. Accordingly,

compensation payments to the depositors of CIFL

commenced from 27 August 2018 in accordance

with the Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance Scheme

Regulation and the total compensation payments

made at 31 December 2018 amounted to Rs. 597.6

million.

The Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance and

Liquidity Supports Scheme (SLDILSS) which

is maintained as a resolution procedure for

financial institutions licensed under the Central

Bank, comprised of 75 member institutions

with a total fund of approximately Rs. 53 billion

(unaudited) at end 2018. Licensed banks which

maintained a capital adequacy ratio of 14 per cent

or above at the end of the immediately preceding

financial year were required to pay a premium of

0.10 per cent per annum on the total amount of all

eligible deposits and all other banks were charged a

premium of 0.125 per cent per annum. The premium

applicable for licensed finance companies was

0.15 per cent per annum. Premia and penalties from

member institutions during the year amounted to

Rs. 8.8 billion. With effect from 01 January 2018,

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

2988

the deposit insurance coverage per depositor per

institution is Rs. 600,000.

In order to streamline the resolution

and enforcement actions in accordance

with the prevailing laws and regulations, a

comprehensive Resolution Framework for the

financial institutions licensed by the Central

Bank would be developed.

Credit Information

The Credit Information Bureau continued to

experience a considerable growth in demand

for credit reports during the year 2018 with an

increase of 9.2 per cent compared to previous

year. During 2018 the CRIB issued a total of

9.9 million credit reports to the industry of which

96 per cent were consumer credit reports. Demand

for reports on commercial loan facilities has also

seen a 12 per cent increase compared to 2017.

Demand for self-inquiry credit reports

(iReports) continued to increase further in 2018.

The number of customers who requested their own

credit reports from the bureau increased compared to

the last year. The number of disputes raised against

the information contained in iReports decreased on

a year-on-year basis. The bureau initiated several

measures to improve data submission standards and

enhance the quality of data. The bureau database

now receives monthly updates of more than 11

million credit facilities.

The Credit Information Management System

(CRIMS), the ICT infrastructure and the bureau

application system maintained by the CRIB

was able to meet the growing demand for credit

information services. However, the CRIB is in the

process of revamping this infrastructure to reposition

its business model to meet emerging market needs

and future demand for credit information services with

an enhanced capacity and agility. CRIB will be able

to add more value to the data it collects in line with its

new development road map, whilst delivering service

and operational efficiency to all stakeholders. CRIB

is currently devising a 5-year development road map

along with the proposed system upgrade to cater to

the present development needs of the bureau.

During 2018, security rights registration, an

electronic register maintained by the Bureau

continued its operations, recording a total

of 13,713 transactions reported by member

institutions, who are currently active in the

system. Since its implementation, growth of the

registry operations had been below expectations,

due to legal constraints in the STR Act. However,

the CRIB has actively engaged in the ongoing

effort to strengthen the Secured Transactions legal

framework with other stakeholders. During the year

CRIB also spearheaded the task force on ‘Getting

Credit’ formed by the Cabinet of Ministers, for the

World Bank Doing Business Survey Project.
