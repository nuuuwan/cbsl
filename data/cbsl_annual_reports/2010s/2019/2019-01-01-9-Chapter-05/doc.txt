5.1 OverviewS

ri Lanka’s external sector experienced

significant pressure, particularly during

the second half of 2018, due to both

external and domestic factors, while the policy

measures taken helped increase resilience

towards the end of the year. On the external

front, the broad-based strengthening of the US

dollar following the policy interest rate hikes in

the USA resulted in foreign investment outflows

from emerging markets, including Sri Lanka. On

the domestic front, the trade deficit expanded

more than expected during the first three

quarters of the year, as the growth of import

expenditure outpaced the growth of export

earnings. Reflecting the impact of the expanded

trade deficit and heightened capital outflows

on the back of tightening global financial

market conditions, the liquidity conditions in the

domestic foreign exchange market remained

mostly tight during the second half of 2018.

Consequently, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated

significantly by end 2018, despite the substantial

build-up of official reserves in the early part of

2018. Meanwhile, adverse developments in the

political environment towards the end of the year

led to subdued investor sentiment, intensifying

the pressure in the external sector. Considering

these developments, the Central Bank and

government initiated measures to curtail

non-essential imports by way of increasing

tariff and margin requirements, reducing the

loan-to-value ratios, suspending the use of

permits for vehicle imports, among others.

Consequently, the external sector began to

witness improved resilience towards the end

of the year as the trade deficit decelerated

markedly, reflecting the impact of policy

measures adopted to curtail imports, while the

financial account began to strengthen with some

inflows into the government securities market,

and the moderation of foreign investment

outflows due to an improvement in the external

environment as a result of the dovish monetary

policy stance of the Federal Reserve of the USA

towards the end of 2018, lower oil prices and a

reduction in trade tensions.

The current account deficit expanded

notably in 2018. The current account deficit

increased to 3.2 per cent of GDP in 2018 from

2.6 per cent of GDP in 2017, owing to the

widened trade deficit, and a moderation in the

secondary income balance, despite a healthy

growth in the trade in services balance. In the

trade account, higher than expected growth in

import expenditure, particularly in categories

such as vehicles, fuel and gold in the early part

of 2018, outpaced the growth in export earnings,

resulting in a considerable widening of the trade

deficit. Reflecting the impact of remedial policy

measures, the trade deficit declined significantly

in November and December 2018, easing the

pressure on the exchange rate and the Balance

of Payments (BOP). Meanwhile, the primary

income account deficit recorded a marginal

increase with an increase of interest payments

on foreign loans by the government and dividend

payments by direct investment enterprises

(DIEs), while the reinvested earnings of DIEs

declined significantly. However, the surplus in

the services account increased during the year,

mainly driven by earnings from tourism and the

healthy inflows to the transport and computer

services sub-sectors. Meanwhile, the surplus

in the secondary income account reduced

marginally compared to 2017, as workers’

remittances, which recorded an increase through

the first nine months of the year, moderated in

the last quarter of 2018.

The financial account was augmented with

higher inflows during 2018. The proceeds of two

(FDI) inflows supported the financial account

during the year. However, outflows of foreign

investments from the government securities

market and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE)

exerted pressure on the financial account. Other

major outflows in the financial account were

payments relating to the maturity of international

bonds issued by the banking sector. With these

developments, the gross official reserves,

which reached the historically highest level

of US dollars 9.9 billion at end April 2018,

moderated thereafter and declined to US dollars

6.9 billion by end 2018, mainly reflecting the

impact of increased debt service payments and

intervention by the Central Bank in the domestic

foreign exchange market. Consequently, the

overall balance recorded a deficit of US dollars

1,103 million in 2018.

The Central Bank continued to pursue a

market based exchange rate policy in 2018, where

interventions were limited only to address any

undue fluctuations of the rupee. The Central Bank

allowed greater flexibility in the determination

of the exchange rate during the year amidst

tight liquidity conditions in the domestic foreign

exchange market, particularly during the second

half of the year. The broad-based strengthening

of the US dollar globally resulted in substantial

outflows of foreign investments as in a number

of other emerging markets, particularly countries

with current account deficits. This, coupled with

a surge in import expenditure, dried up liquidity

in the domestic foreign exchange market,

thereby exerting significant pressure on the

Sri Lankan rupee. Given the significant intraday

volatility in the exchange rate, which intensified

in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Central Bank

adopted a cautious approach in intervening

in the domestic foreign exchange market,

while also maintaining the official reserves at

a prudent level. Consequently, the Sri Lankan

rupee depreciated by 16.4 per cent against

the US dollar in 2018, while the Central Bank

supplied US dollars 1,120 million to the domestic

foreign exchange market on a net basis. Further,

the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) index,

which is an indicator of Sri Lanka’s external

competitiveness, remained predominantly below

the base year level in 2018, signifying Sri Lanka’s

sustained external competitiveness.

The external sector showed improved

resilience towards the end of 2018 and through

the first quarter of 2019. The impact of policy

measures introduced in curtailing certain

non-essential imports, the moderation of outflows

from the government securities market and

the improved political environment resulted in

stabilising the external sector towards the end

of 2018. The perceived delay in further rate

hikes by the Federal Reserve of the United

States, the positive investor outlook resulting

from the repayment of US dollars 1 billion ISB in

January 2019 by the Government, the extension

of the IMF - EFF and the successful issuance

of ISBs amounting to US dollars 2.4 billion in

March 2019 are some noteworthy developments

that contributed in improving resilience in the

external sector during the first quarter of 2019.

Consequently, the Sri Lankan rupee, which

depreciated significantly during 2018, gained

value in the first quarter of 2019, recording an

appreciation of over 3 per cent. However, the

relatively larger debt servicing obligations and

the need to build buffers by augmenting official

reserves remain a challenge in the medium term.

In this context, reducing the reliance on foreign

borrowings to finance the current account deficit,

maintaining a sustainable current account deficit

and bolstering official reserves through long term

non-debt creating capital flows would be major

priorities. Attracting FDI into the export oriented

manufacturing and services sectors with an

annual target of above US dollars 3 billion would

be desirable to keep foreign borrowings at a

minimum level in financing the current account

deficit. Further, the timely implementation of

appropriate measures towards harnessing the

potential of services exports could ensure much

needed foreign exchange inflows to the country

over the medium term.

The external sector outlook in 2019 remains

positive despite some downside risks. The deficits

in the trade and current accounts are expected

to contract during 2019 with the anticipated

deceleration in imports, while export growth is

expected to continue the upbeat momentum in

2019. The surplus in the services account is

expected to improve, supported mainly by tourist

earnings, albeit the deficit in the primary income

account is expected to widen during the year

amidst tighter global financial market conditions.

Foreign exchange inflows from workers’

remittances are expected to remain at a level

comparable to 2018, maintaining the recent trend.

Meanwhile, the financial account of the BOP is

expected to improve with higher FDI inflows,

while foreign investment to the CSE and the

government securities market are also expected

to stabilise. Further, the recommencement of

the IMF - EFF is also expected to strengthen the

external sector with improved investor sentiment.

The official reserves are expected to remain

at adequate levels supported by measures for

building up external buffers during the year.

Nonetheless, the external sector outlook in 2019

could experience downside risks due to potential

vulnerabilities. Particularly, the probable removal

of the suspension of permits for importing motor

vehicles could result in reversing the favourable

adjustment observed in the trade balance. In

addition, a rise in global fuel prices, coupled

with adverse domestic weather conditions,

could result in increasing the expenditure on

fuel imports. Further, any unforeseen changes

in the pace and magnitude of the interest rate

normalisation in advanced economies could

destabilise cross border capital flows, affecting

the financial account of the BOP.

5.2 External Trade Policies, Developments and Institutional Support

The measures taken towards promoting and

facilitating external trade through streamlining

and enhancing institutional support helped

further strengthen the external trade policy

environment in 2018. Sri Lanka signed a bilateral

trade agreement with Singapore in January 2018,

which came into force in May 2018, marking the

first comprehensive bilateral trade agreement

of Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, negotiations on

comprehensive bilateral trade agreements with

Thailand, China and India continued during 2018.

The Generalised System of Preferences (GSP)

facility offered by the USA to low and middle

income countries was extended through end 2020.

Several measures were taken to further improve

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

146

5

the utilisation of the GSP facilities of the USA

and the European Union (EU). Steps were also

taken to implement the New Trade Policy (NTP),

which was introduced in 2017, aimed at improving

competitiveness through trade liberalisation, while

attracting investment to drive Sri Lanka into the

global value chains (GVCs). In support of this

process, a Trade Adjustment Programme (TAP)

was being developed, helping firms and individuals

to face competition. Major legislation on promoting

best trade practices was passed in Parliament,

namely, Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties

Act and Safeguard Measures Act, thereby guarding

the local industry from unfair trade practices.

Meanwhile, the National Export Strategy (NES)

2018-2022 was launched in July 2018 to fast

track export promotion. Accordingly, four trade

supporting functions and six focus sectors have

been identified, along with a comprehensive set of

plan of actions. Further, as per the Trade Facilitation

Agreement (TFA) of the World Trade Organization

(WTO), the Trade Information Portal (TIP) was

launched in July 2018, while the establishment of

the National Single Window (NSW) was in progress.

Meanwhile, the Board of Investment (BOI) initiated

a web-based single window in order to expedite

investment approvals. Reflecting the impact of such

measures, Sri Lanka’s rank in the Ease of Doing

Business Index in 2019 improved to 100 from 111

ranked in 2018, while further improvements are

expected along with the implementation of the

proposed policy measures during 2019.

Exports under the GSP schemes of the EU

and USA and the India - Sri Lanka Free Trade

Agreement (ISLFTA) mainly contributed to the

export volume under preferential agreements.

Since the reinstatement of the EU GSP+ scheme in

May 2017, exports to the EU grew notably through

this scheme, benefitting from the removal of duties

for 66 per cent of total tariff lines. Garments, rubber

products, tea, food, beverages and tobacco, and

seafood were the main export categories under

the EU GSP+. Sri Lanka has made an effort to

enhance utilisation of the EU GSP+ scheme

through regional cumulation, by requesting

permission to source material from selected

regional countries. For instance, a joint request

was made by the governments of Sri Lanka and

Indonesia to the EU in 2018 seeking permission

for the Sri Lankan apparel sector to use imported

material from Indonesia, while another proposal

was made by Sri Lanka regarding apparel material

sourced from South Korea under the extended

cumulation rule of the EU GSP+. Exports under the

US GSP, which accounted for 15 per cent of total

exports under preferential agreements, declined

in 2018. Meanwhile, following the decision by

the USA to include travel goods in the GSP, all

beneficiary countries including Sri Lanka were

eligible for duty free access to export travel goods

to the US with effect from 01 July 2018. Sri Lanka

continued to benefit from GSP schemes offered

by several other developed countries such as the

Russian Federation, Japan, Australia, Turkey,

Canada and Switzerland, albeit their contribution

to exports remained relatively low. Meanwhile,

Sri Lanka’s exports increased under the Global

System of Trade Preferences (GSTP) Agreement

in 2018, mainly led by cinnamon exports to Mexico,

Peru and Ecuador. The narrow export base and

low product penetration prevent Sri Lanka from

harnessing the full benefit of such GSP schemes.

Further efforts were made to reach

potential markets through new bilateral FTAs

while achieving better positioning in the

GVCs. After eight rounds of negotiations, the

Sri Lanka - Singapore Free Trade Agreement

(SLSFTA) was signed in January 2018 and

enforced in May 2018. The SLSFTA was

Sri Lanka’s first comprehensive FTA covering

trade in goods and services, investment promotion,

trade remedies, telecommunications, e-commerce,

government procurement, competition, intellectual

property rights (IPR) and transparency. Despite the

broad coverage of the SLSFTA, Sri Lanka is mainly

expected to benefit from business opportunities

from trade in services and investments from

Singapore, since Singapore generally offers

duty-free market access for over 99 per cent of tariff

lines of goods. Under the first phase of the Tariff

Liberalisation Programme (TLP) of the SLSFTA,

Sri Lanka liberalised 50 per cent (3,719) of tariff

lines. However, amidst concerns raised by several

stakeholders over the SLSFTA, a committee of

experts was appointed in order to further review

and submit a report on the SLSFTA. Consequently,

further discussions on such concerns and the

way forward of the SLSFTA will be determined

at joint committee meetings that are to be held

in the future. Sri Lanka is also expected to enter

into a comprehensive FTA with China. Six rounds

of negotiations have already been completed and

further negotiations are expected in 2019. The

proposed China - Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement

(CSFTA) is expected to cover trade in goods and

services, investment promotion, technical barriers

to trade, trade facilitation, and economic and

technological cooperation. Meanwhile, a scoping

session for a comprehensive FTA between

Sri Lanka and Thailand (SLTFTA) was held in May

2018 and two negotiation rounds were held in July

and September 2018. During these negotiations,

nine working groups were established and the

scope of the working groups and a work plan

were discussed. Meanwhile, negotiations on the

proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation

Agreement (ETCA) between India and Sri Lanka

continued during the year and 11 rounds were

completed by September 2018. The ETCA is also

a comprehensive agreement that extends the

existing ISLFTA, thereby, covering the areas of

trade in goods and services, investment promotion

and economic and technological cooperation.

One of the major objectives of the ETCA would

be to resolve issues that were encountered in

the implementation of the ISLFTA. Moreover, the

ETCA gives special attention to non-tariff barriers

(NTBs), such as quality standards and sanitary and

phyto-sanitary (SPS) measures, which were

identified as major hindrances in current bilateral

trade. Further, since India terminated its bilateral

investment treaties in March 2017, the investment

chapter of the ETCA is expected to promote

investment flows between the two countries.

Also, the chapter on economic and technological

cooperation is expected to strengthen cooperation

in several sectors of the economy, such as

agriculture, education, tourism, transport, aviation

and ports, energy, science, technology and

research. Further, during 2018, initial studies and

discussions were held with Malaysia, Indonesia

and Bangladesh in order to explore avenues for

potential FTAs.

Several measures were taken to further

enhance the use of existing bilateral trade

agreements, considering the low trade volumes

under these FTAs despite the higher utilisation

rates. The ISLFTA, which has been in effect since

2000 was the major bilateral FTA contributing to

the growth in Sri Lanka’s exports. Exports under

the ISLFTA have increased, in 2018, with the

utilisation of the ISLFTA favouring Sri Lanka. About

62 per cent of Sri Lanka’s exports to India were

channeled through the FTA, led by animal

feed, base metals and articles, and garments,

compared to about 6 per cent of imports

from India that took place under the FTA. The

government continued to engage in resolving

the implementation issues related to the ISLFTA,

such as quantitative restrictions on apparel

and black pepper, procedures on Customs

clearance and sample testing, especially on

tea, excessive documentation charges and

delays. Meanwhile, exports under the Pakistan -

Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (PSFTA) declined

during 2018. The major products exported by

Sri Lanka under the PSFTA included betel leaves

and medium-density fibre (MDF) boards. In terms

of utilisation, exports through the PSFTA remained

high at about 67 per cent, while imports through the

PSFTA were low at about 10 per cent, indicating

gains from the utilisation of the PSFTA during

2018 despite lower trade volumes. Accordingly, it

is evident that as regards to ISLFTA and PSFTA,

Sri Lanka has maintained a favourable trade

balance under both FTAs.

At a time when there is an impasse in the

Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations,

engagement with regional preferential trade

agreements needs to be further strengthened

given the importance of enhancing cooperation

among regional trade and services networks.

The Agreement on the South Asian Free Trade

Area (SAFTA), which was entered into in 2006,

aimed at furthering the South Asian Association for

Regional Cooperation (SAARC) regional economic

integration through the promotion of preferential

trade, by replacing the South Asian Preferential

Trading Arrangement (SAPTA). This has resulted

in a decline in the usage of the SAPTA over time,

while the utilisation of the SAFTA also remained

low in 2018. The first and second phases of the

TLP of the SAFTA were completed by Sri Lanka

in 2015 and 2018, respectively. Exports under the

Asia - Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA) increased

in 2018, including mainly black tea, activated

carbon, garments and coconut products mainly to

China. Participating countries of APTA agreed to

implement the fourth round of concessions from

01 January 2018, as per the decision taken at

the 51st Standing Committee held in September

2017, and Sri Lanka implemented these

concessions in March 2018. Meanwhile, at the

21st Trade Negotiation Committee of the Bay

of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical

and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), held in

November 2018, an agreement was reached to

expedite the implementation of the BIMSTEC FTA

on merchandise goods.

Sri Lanka’s engagement with the WTO

continued in 2018, along with the implementation

of the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement

(TFA). Sri Lanka ratified the TFA in May 2016,

which came into effect in February 2017. Since

then, Sri Lanka has notified its commitments to the

WTO as specified under the categories “A”, “B” and

“C”. In fulfilment of Sri Lanka’s commitments under

the TFA, the Trade Information Portal (TIP) was

launched in July 2018, which contained trade related

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

149

regulatory information on a single web portal. The

TIP, which is supported by 43 stakeholders and

managed by the Department of Commerce (DOC),

serves as a major step in facilitating cross border

trade to ensure the smooth flow of trade. The other

major initiative of the TFA, the NSW, is in progress

with the assistance of the World Bank, where the

blueprint is being finalised. Following the 11th

WTO Ministerial Conference held in December

2017, new subject issues increasingly relevant

to the trade agenda in the current global context

emerged, albeit a consensus on the proceedings

of these subject issues are yet to be reached.

Such new issues include e-commerce, investment

facilitation, micro, small and medium enterprises

(MSMEs) and domestic regulation in services.

Several major initiatives were implemented

in 2018, aimed at strengthening policy and

institutional support for export promotion.

Measures under the New Trade Policy (NTP)

were initiated in the areas of trade liberalisation,

investment promotion and participation in

product sharing networks. A Trade Adjustment

Programme (TAP) was introduced in support of a

smooth transition of firms and workers to the new

market conditions, which could indirectly affect

domestic industries through the reforms proposed

by the NTP. With the objective of enabling the

implementation of the TAP in a productive manner,

the Cabinet approved to establish the Trade and

Productivity Commission and a Joint Steering

Committee in March 2019. Meanwhile, the Ministry

of Development Strategies and International Trade

(MODSIT), together with the Export Development

Board (EDB) implemented the NES 2018-2022

in July 2018 and the action plan under the NES

has already been operationalised (refer Box 2 for

further details of NES 2018-2022). The MODSIT

developed several strategies such as “National

Quality Infrastructure” and “Innovation and

Entrepreneurship Strategy 2018-2022”, in order to

address issues of low export products and market

diversification. Further, the MODSIT coordinated

activities of eight task forces under the road map

for investment climate reforms, introduced in 2017

with the aim of improving the overall ranking of

Sri Lanka’s Ease of Doing Business to 70 by 2020.

These task forces streamlined and expedited

several activities during 2018, which helped

improve the Ease of Doing Business Ranking for

2019 by 11 points to 100. In addition to launching

the NES 2018-2022 and related activities of its

action plan, the EDB initiated several new measures

while continuing a number of programmes already

initiated towards export promotion. The EDB

commenced several new programmes, such as

the market access support scheme, IT initiative,

multinational corporation outreach programme

for electrical and electronic components sector,

establishment of infrastructure facilities and

development of a regulatory framework for the boat

building sector, establishment of an EDB owned

trade promotion platform (eMARKETPLACE) and

the “Arambuma” credit scheme as initiated in the

Budget 2018. In addition, national programmes

to transform 2,000 regional small and medium

enterprises (SMEs) as new export champions,

promote women entrepreneurs and set up farmer

clusters on selected value added products under

the “One Village One Product” concept were

further expanded, creating direct and indirect new

exporters in identified regions. The selected new

exporters benefitted from awareness programmes,

domestic and foreign trade fair visits and technical

assistance. Further, routine activities in relation to

market access, trade promotion and facilitation,

such as participation in recognised foreign trade

fairs, facilitation of inward and outward trade

delegations, conducting the Exporters’ Fora to

solve trade related issues and appreciation of

exporters through award ceremonies continued

during 2018. The Trade Chambers also contributed

towards export promotion throughout the year,

which was helpful in connecting the state and

private sector stakeholders in areas such as

policy making, grievance handling and negotiating

trade agreements. The Trade Chambers were

involved in stakeholder consultations, awareness

campaigns and capacity building programmes

for exporters. Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Customs

(SLC) streamlined its activities further in relation

to container handling, automation and clearing,

examining and monitoring processes.

The budget 2019 announced several new

proposals to promote exports while enacting

trade supportive legislation during 2018. The

Budget 2019 proposed to further continue phasing

out para-tariffs on selected items over a 5-year

period. Further, measures to facilitate trade through

the Export Market Access Programme and the TAP

were introduced. In line with NES and the NTP, the

private sector will be encouraged to establish new

research facilities and trading houses in priority

sectors as well as to rehabilitate harbour facilities.

Meanwhile, the launch of an enterprise innovation

programme was proposed in order to support the

development of innovative products. Further, two

industrial zones are to be established in Bingiriya

and Wagawatte, while several industrial estates in

the North and the East are proposed. Meanwhile,

para-tariffs and customs duties on importation of

selected products such as construction material and

goods used for hotel refurbishment were reduced

with a view to lowering the cost of production. In

order to rationalise imports of motor vehicles,

excise duty on selected motor vehicles was revised

upward, while the margin deposit requirements

against the letters of credit (LCs) were removed.

Newly initiated strategies, policy reforms,

institutional support and the competitive

exchange rate are expected to bolster trade

performance in the period ahead, while global

developments and unresolved domestic

impediments would continue to challenge

the sustainability of the trade performance.

The record high export earnings and FDI inflows,

improvement in the Doing Business Index,

enforcement of a new bilateral FTA, launching

the NES 2018-2022 and TIP, enactment of trade

remedies and maintaining a flexible exchange

rate regime were the main achievements that

underpinned the external trade performance in

2018. The reinstatement of the EU GSP+, in 2017,

and removal of the ban on the export of fisheries

products to the EU market, in 2016, have yielded

positive results. However, the record high imports,

lower competitiveness led by lower productivity and

high cost of production, impact of climate change

etc. remain as major domestic challenges for a

sustainable trade performance. In addition, the

protectionist trade policies by developed countries

leading to trade disputes especially between the

US and China, and the resulting spillover effects

on global trade and growth, the Brexit, geopolitical

tensions among major trading partners, low

participation in GVCs, high and volatile crude

oil prices and the risk of losing preferential

access due to the graduation of the country to

upper-middle income status remain as major

concerns. However, new strategies introduced to

facilitate trade liberalisation and reforms such as

the NTP, the NES 2018-2022, Investor Roadmap

have identified the major issues and challenges to

the external trade sector and remedial measures

are being implemented. The timely implementation

of identified strategies is imperative. However, the

full implementation of the remedial measures would

take considerable time given the structural nature

of the issues. Priority should be given to removing

supply side constraints such as high production costs

and lack of required labour, creation of an export

culture supported by Research and Development

(R&D) led innovation and the rationalisation of

the institutional framework to create a trade and

investor friendly environment. Further efforts to

enhance market access through new FTAs as

well as increased economic cooperation would be

necessary. Although the graduation of Sri Lanka to

an upper-middle income country status would be

beneficial, the country should be prepared to face

the risks attached to graduation, such as removal of

preferential market access and adjustment should

be planned in advance for a smooth transition.

5.3 Trade in Goods, Trade Balance,

Terms of Trade and Direction of Trade

5.3.1 Export Performance

Earnings from merchandise exports, which

rebounded strongly in 2017, continued to

maintain its growth momentum in 2018. The

restoration of the EU GSP+ facility, conducive

external trade policies together with strong

institutional support and the flexible exchange rate

policy maintained by the Central Bank underpinned

the performance of export earnings. Accordingly,

earnings from exports increased by 4.7 per cent to

US dollars 11,890 million in 2018, from US dollars

11,360 million in 2017. Earnings from industrial

exports contributed to the expansion in export

earnings in 2018, while earnings from agricultural

and mineral exports declined.

Earnings from industrial exports increased

in 2018, mainly with the support of the

restoration of the EU GSP+ facility. Industrial

exports, which accounted for around 78 per cent

of total exports, increased by 8.4 per cent to US

dollars 9,258 million, in 2018, in comparison to

the previous year. Higher performance registered

in earnings from textiles and garments, petroleum

products, rubber products, food, beverages

and tobacco, and machinery and mechanical

appliances mainly contributed to this increase.

Reflecting the positive impact of the restoration

of the EU GSP+ facility, since May 2017, export

earnings from textiles and garments increased by

5.7 per cent, on a year-on-year basis, to US dollars

5,318 million in 2018. Despite a decline in demand

from the UK, which was the largest market in the

EU region, earnings from garment exports to the

EU market increased by 3.6 per cent to US dollars

2,053 million during the year, owing to the higher

demand from Germany, Italy, Netherlands and

Sweden. Further, earnings from garment exports to

the USA increased by 6.0 per cent, while earnings

from non-traditional markets such as India, Japan,

Australia and Mexico increased by 3.5 per cent in

2018. Due to increased demand for textiles and

made up textile articles from the EU market, the

USA, India, Vietnam and Turkey, export earnings

from those categories also increased by 26.6 per

cent and 10.9 per cent, respectively, in 2018.

Export earnings from petroleum products increased

significantly by 43.2 per cent in 2018, due to the

combined impact of higher export volumes and

prices of bunker and aviation fuel. Export prices

of bunker and aviation fuel increased considerably

by 29.4 per cent, in line with the higher oil prices

that prevailed in the international market during

the year. Earnings from exports of rubber products

increased by 4.8 per cent to US dollars 875 million

during the year, compared to the previous year,

mainly due to the improved performance in rubber

tyre exports. Further, export earnings from food,

beverages and tobacco rose by 17.7 per cent

to US dollars 462 million in 2018, owing to the

improved performance of all sub categories except

cereal preparations. Also, export earnings from

machinery and mechanical appliances increased by

17.3 per cent, on a year-on-year basis, in 2018 due

to increased performance registered in almost all

sub categories, particularly in electronic equipment

and insulated wires, cables and conductors. In

addition, earnings from gems, diamonds and

jewellery, base metals and articles, chemical

products and animal fodder contributed to boost

industrial exports during the year. However,

earnings from transport equipment declined by 25.9

per cent to US dollars 120 million, in 2018, mainly

due to the base effect, as three ships were exported

to Singapore in 2017. Further, export earnings from

leather, travel goods and footwear declined by 6.8

per cent, while earnings from printing industry

products and ceramic products declined by

35.2 per cent and 7.3 per cent, respectively, during

the year, in comparison to the previous year.

Performance of agricultural exports

deteriorated in 2018. Agricultural exports,

which accounted for about 22 per cent of total

exports, declined by 6.8 per cent, year-on-year,

to US dollars 2,579 million in 2018 due to poor

performance in almost all sub categories except

seafood. Earnings from tea exports, which grew

significantly in the previous year with the support

of favourable international tea prices, declined by

6.6 per cent to US dollars 1,428 million in 2018,

due to the combined impact of lower average

export prices and reduced exported volumes

of tea. Although the higher volume of black tea

production and exports, particularly from Africa,

resulted in a decline in the international tea prices

at the Mombasa and Kolkata auctions, prices of

Sri Lankan Orthodox tea remained relatively strong

due to the limited supply. However, despite an

increase observed in the first quarter of 2018, the

average export price of one kilogram of tea declined

during the year to US dollars 5.06, in comparison to

US dollars 5.29 in 2017, due to restricted trade with

Iran and Russia following the imposition of sanctions

on these countries. The volume of tea exported

declined by 2.3 per cent in 2018, compared to the

previous year, with the lower production owing to

work stoppage due to wage negotiations as well

as adverse weather conditions that prevailed in

some months. In 2018, Turkey continued to be the

number one importer of Sri Lankan tea, in value

terms, followed by Russia, Iraq and Iran, jointly

contributing for about 41 per cent of earnings

from tea exports. Despite an increase observed in

export earnings from non-kernel coconut products,

earnings from coconut exports declined by

10.6 per cent to US dollars 311 million in 2018, due

to the significant decline in export earnings from

coconut kernel products. In 2018, export earnings

from coconut kernel products decreased by

21.3 per cent mainly due to lower exported

volumes of desiccated coconut and coconut oil with

the reduced production of coconut during the first

half of 2018, owing to the lagged effect of adverse

weather conditions. Export earnings from coconut

non-kernel products increased by 2.3 per cent

owing to higher performance in fibre exports.

Further, export earnings from spices reduced by

11.3 per cent to US dollars 360 million in 2018,

compared to the previous year, led by the poor

performance in almost all categories of spices,

except cinnamon. While earnings from most of

the spices such as cloves, pepper and nutmeg

and mace declined with the reduction in exported

volumes due to poor harvest, earnings from

cinnamon exports increased with high export

volumes. Further, export earnings from minor

agricultural products declined by 14.7 per cent to

US dollars 118 million during the year due to the

lower performance of most categories particularly

arecanut, betel leaves and fruit. In addition,

export earnings from rubber, vegetables and

unmanufactured tobacco also declined in 2018.

However, earnings from seafood exports continued

to rise by 10.5 per cent, to US dollars 266 million

in 2018, benefitting from the removal of the ban on

the exports of fisheries products to the EU and the

restoration of GSP+ facility. Accordingly, seafood

exports to the EU market increased significantly by

37.5 per cent to US dollars 92 million during the

year, due to the higher demand from France, Italy,

Germany, Spain and Netherlands.

Earnings from mineral exports declined

marginally by 0.4 per cent, year-on-year, to

US dollars 34 million in 2018. Despite an

increase in export earnings from ores, slag and

ash, earnings from mineral exports decreased

during the year due to reductions in earnings from

earths and stones, and precious metals.

5.3.2 Import Performance

The substantial growth in expenditure on

merchandise imports which was experienced

in the first half of 2018, gradually decelerated

during the second half of the year due to the

implementation of macroprudential measures

by the Central Bank and the Government

together with a relatively sharper depreciation

of the Sri Lankan rupee. Accordingly, expenditure

on imports increased by 6.0 per cent to US dollars

22,233 million, in 2018, in comparison to US dollars

20,980 million in 2017. The higher expenditure

incurred on fuel, personal motor vehicles, textiles

and textile articles, and fertiliser mainly contributed

to the growth in imports during 2018. Meanwhile,

expenditure on non-fuel imports also increased by

3.0 per cent to US dollars 18,081 million during the

year, compared to the previous year.

Expenditure on intermediate goods imports,

which accounted for about 56 per cent of total

imports, contributed largely to the expansion

in import expenditure in 2018. Accordingly,

expenditure on intermediate goods imports

increased by 9.2 per cent, year-on-year, to

US dollars 12,488 million in 2018. Expenditure

on fuel imports increased substantially by

21.1 per cent to US dollars 4,152 million, in

2018, compared to the previous year, mainly

due to the significant increase in average

import prices of both refined petroleum products

and crude oil, as well as a moderate growth

of imported volumes of those items. The

average import price of crude oil increased by

31.9 per cent to US dollars 76.25 per barrel during

the year, from US dollars 57.79 per barrel, in 2017,

reflecting the higher oil prices in the international

market. Meanwhile, import expenditure on coal

declined by 9.5 per cent to US dollars 237 million,

in 2018, compared to the previous year, due to

a reduction in the imported volume of coal with

the decline in coal power generation. Further, in

line with the high demand for textiles and garment

exports, expenditure on the import of textiles and

textile articles increased by 4.9 per cent in 2018,

led by an increase in almost all sub-categories,

particularly in fabric and yarn imports. Import

expenditure on fertiliser increased considerably,

in 2018, due to the combined impact of higher

imported volumes and average import prices of

fertiliser. Imported volumes of fertiliser increased

significantly by 116.2 per cent, in 2018, partly due

to the base effect of lower demand for fertiliser

in 2017, owing to reduced agricultural activity as

a result of the adverse weather conditions that

prevailed in 2017 and the extended cultivated area

of paddy in 2018 with better weather, together

with the reintroduction of the fertiliser subsidy

instead of cash grants. The average import price

of fertiliser increased during the year in line with

higher fertiliser prices in the international market.

In addition, import expenditure on chemical

products, plastic and articles thereof, base metals

and paper, paperboard and articles thereof

increased during the year, contributing towards

the higher expenditure on intermediate goods.

The sharp decline in gold imports following

the policy measures, as well as lower imports

of rubber and articles thereof and mineral

products contributed to decelerating import

expenditure on intermediate goods in 2018.

Import expenditure on diamonds, precious stones

and metals declined considerably by 25.9 per cent

in 2018 compared to 2017, due to a decline of

32.5 per cent reported in the importation of gold,

reflecting the impact of the imposition of customs

duty by the government on the importation of gold.

Expenditure on gold imports increased substantially

by 126.5 per cent to US dollars 437 million during

the first four months of 2018. Considering the

possible illicit arbitrage resulting from the tariff

differential between India and Sri Lanka on gold

imports, due to a 10 per cent customs duty in India

and zero per cent in Sri Lanka, the Government

of Sri Lanka re-imposed a 15 per cent customs

duty on the importation of gold, since April 2018.

As a result, import expenditure on gold declined

considerably since May 2018, amounting to a

marginal value of around US dollars 1 million during

the remaining eight months of the year. Meanwhile,

import expenditure on rubber and articles thereof

decreased by 6.6 per cent due to lower import of

rubber in primary forms, while import expenditure

on mineral products also declined by 14.0 per cent

owing to reduced import expenditure on cement

clinker. Expenditure on food preparations also

decreased in 2018.

Expenditure on consumer goods, which

accounted for 22 per cent of total imports,

increased in 2018 due to high expenses that

were incurred on non-food consumer goods

despite the decline in expenditure on food

and beverages. Accordingly, expenditure on

consumer goods increased by 10.6 per cent,

year-on-year, to US dollars 4,980 million,

compared to US dollars 4,503 million in 2017.

Import expenditure on food and beverages

declined by 12.8 per cent to US dollars 1,606

million in 2018, mainly due to the reduction in

expenditure on rice imports. Despite an increase in

average import prices of rice, in line with the higher

price in the international market, expenditure

on rice imports decreased significantly by

64.5 per cent to US dollars 107 million in 2018, in

comparison to US dollars 301 million in 2017, due

to the decline in imported volumes of rice with

the increased domestic supply of rice following a

recovery in the paddy harvest. Accordingly, rice

import volumes declined to 249 million kilograms,

in 2018, from 748 million kilograms in 2017.

Further, expenditure on vegetables also declined

considerably by 17.4 per cent, in 2018, owing to

lower imports of most vegetable categories such

as lentils, onions, leguminous vegetables and

potatoes. Also, import expenditure on seafood,

and sugar and confectionary declined by

9.3 per cent and 3.2 per cent, respectively.

However, import expenditure on spices, dairy

products, beverages and fruit increased in 2018.

Expenditure on the importation of personal

motor vehicles contributed significantly to the

increase in expenditure on non-food consumer

goods imports in 2018. Accordingly, import

expenditure on non-food consumer goods increased

substantially by 26.8 per cent, year-on-year, to

US dollars 3,374 million in 2018. Reflecting the

impact of the revised tax structure for vehicle

imports in the Budget 2018, expenditure on personal

motor vehicle imports increased noticeably by

116.3 per cent during the first eight months of the

year, mainly due to the increase in the importation of

vehicles with small engine capacity, hybrid and electric

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

vehicles. Therefore, considering the pressure on the

external sector and mainly on the exchange rate from

increased vehicle imports, both the Central Bank and

the Government introduced several policy measures

during the period from August to November 2018,

with the intention of curtailing high vehicle imports

(Refer Table 5.6). However, the immediate effect of

policy measures was not visible during the months of

September and October 2018 as a result of changes

in the structure of the issuance of vehicle permits to

public officials and the anticipation of possible duty

hikes from the Budget 2019 in November 2018.

Nevertheless, reflecting the lag effect of these policy

measures, expenditure on vehicle imports began to

decline from November 2018 and continued through

December 2018, with such expenditure averaging

around US dollars 91 million per month, in comparison

to an average expenditure of US dollars 139 million

per month reported in the first ten months of the year.

Consequently, expenditure on personal motor vehicle

imports increased by 103.6 per cent to US dollars

1,574 million in 2018, in comparison to US dollars

773 million in 2017. Meanwhile, with the intention

of reducing the pressure on imports further, the

Central Bank took policy measures to discourage

non-essential consumer goods imports such as

refrigerators, washing machines, mobile phones,

rubber tyres and perfumes. Accordingly, a 100

per cent margin deposit requirement was imposed

against LCs for certain non-essential consumer

goods imports, with effect from 01 October 2018

and a 100 per cent margin deposit requirement was

also imposed on the invoiced value of imports under

documents against acceptance (DA) terms for such

non-essential consumer goods imports, with effect

from 11 October 2018. Also, authorised dealers

were directed not to release foreign exchange

for making payments for the importation of such

non-essential consumer goods under advance

payment terms with effect from 10 October

2018, while a 100 per cent minimum cash margin

applicable for opening of LCs through foreign

currency for the importation of non-essential goods

was imposed with effect from 26 November 2018.

Subsequently, margin requirements against LCs for

the importation of non-essential consumer goods

were withdrawn with effect from 07 March 2019,

while the margin requirement for importation under

DA terms was removed with effect from 12 March

2019. Expenditure on clothing and accessories,

and household and furniture items declined by

15.9 per cent and 9.0 per cent, respectively, in

2018. However, expenditure on medical and

pharmaceuticals increased during 2018.

Expenditure on investment goods declined

in 2018, reflecting lower imports of all

sub categories. Expenditure on investment

goods imports, which accounted for around

21 per cent of total imports, contracted by

4.2 per cent to US dollars 4,690 million in 2018,

in comparison to US dollars 4,895 million in 2017.

declined by 4.9 per cent to US dollars 2,492 million

in 2018, compared to the previous year, due to

the reduction in imports of engineering equipment,

electrical machinery and equipment, printing

machinery, medical and laboratory equipment and

electronic equipment. Further, import expenditure

on building materials decreased by 4.2 per cent to

US dollars 1,525 million, due to a decline in cement,

iron, steel and articles, and mineral products. Import

expenditure on transport equipment also declined

by 1.0 per cent, due to lower imports of commercial

vehicles such as lorries, buses, vans, agricultural

tractors, and tankers and bowsers.

5.3.3 Trade Balance

The deficit in the trade account widened

in 2018, albeit at a slower pace as the year

progressed, reflecting the impact of prudent

policy measures introduced by the Central

Bank and the Government. The trade deficit

widened significantly during the first half of the

year owing to high import expenditure incurred on

gold, fuel and personal motor vehicles along with

modest export performance. However, the sharp

depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee together

with policy measures to curtail import expenditure

during April 2018 through November 2018 resulted

in a moderation in the expansion of the trade deficit

during the second half of the year. The trade deficit

widened to US dollars 10,343 million in 2018 from

US dollars 9,619 million in 2017. The trade deficit

as a percentage of GDP increased to 11.6 per cent

in 2018 from 10.9 per cent in 2017.

5.3.4 Terms of Trade

The terms of trade, which represents the ratio

between Sri Lanka's export prices and import

prices, remained broadly unchanged in 2018. The

export price index increased by 4.2 per cent to 100.4

index points, while the import price index increased

by 4.1 per cent to 95.1 index points during the

year. With these developments, the terms of trade

improved marginally to 105.6 index points in 2018, in

comparison to 105.5 index points in 2017.

Reflecting higher prices of industrial

exports, the overall export price index rose in

2018. The export price index for industrial exports

increased by 6.7 per cent during the year, mainly

due to a 30.4 per cent increase in the price index in

relation to petroleum products, with high oil prices

in the international market. Further, the export

price indices in respect of textiles and garments,

and gems, diamonds, and Jewellery increased

by 3.6 per cent and 25.2 per cent, respectively, in

2018. In addition, export price indices of chemical

products, ceramic products, rubber products and

leather, travel goods and footwear increased

during the period. However, price indices pertaining

to plastics and articles thereof, machinery and

mechanical appliances, transport equipment, base

metals and articles, and food, beverages and

tobacco, which are categorised under industrial

exports, declined in 2018. Meanwhile, the export

price index of agricultural exports declined by

2.9 per cent in 2018, owing to price declines

reported in many categories such as tea, minor

agricultural products, rubber and spices. However,

export price indices of coconut, seafood and

unmanufactured tobacco increased during the year.

The overall import price index increased

in 2018 mainly due to higher prices of

intermediate goods followed by a marginal

price increase in consumer goods. The import

price index of intermediate goods increased by

6.8 per cent largely due to fuel, which registered

a 19.7 per cent rise, in terms of the price index.

Further, the import price index of paper and

paperboard increased by 6.8 per cent, while that

of chemical products and plastic and articles

increased by 6.0 per cent each in 2018. Import

price indices pertaining to wheat and maize,

vehicle and machinery parts, diamonds, precious

stones and metals, and fertiliser also increased

during the year. Meanwhile, import price indices

categorised under intermediate goods, declined

in 2018. The price index in respect of consumer

goods in 2018 increased marginally by 0.9 per cent

compared to the previous year. Prices of vehicles,

clothing and accessories, printed materials and

stationary, seafood, beverages, and cereals

and milling industry products were higher, while

price indices of home appliances, sugar and

confectionery, vegetables, spices, fruits and dairy

products declined during the year. However, the

import price index for investment goods decreased

in 2018, reflecting lower prices of machinery and

equipment, and building materials, despite an

increase registered in the price index of transport

equipment.

5.3.5 Direction of Trade

Sri Lanka’s major trading partners broadly

remained unchanged in 2018, in comparison

to 2017. India remained Sri Lanka’s major trading

partner, in 2018, followed by China and the

USA. As in 2017, total trade with India exceeded

US dollars 5 billion, while trade with China and the

USA exceeded US dollars 4 billion and US dollars

3 billion, respectively, in 2018, with a share of

14.7 per cent, 12.8 per cent and 10.6 per cent. In

addition, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Japan,

Singapore, the UK and Germany were the other

major trading partners accounting for trade to the

value of more than US dollars 1 billion each in

2018. However, trade with India declined in 2018

due to a reduction in imports from India, while total

trade with Singapore dropped owing to a significant

decline in exports to Singapore. Contrastingly, trade

with China, the USA, the UAE, Japan, the UK and

Germany increased during the year in comparison

to the previous year. Among Sri Lanka’s export

destinations, advanced countries, mainly the USA

and the UK, continued to account for the largest

share, while among Sri Lanka’s sources of imports,

Asia, mainly India and China, accounted for a major

share.

The USA retained its position as the major

export destination, accounting for 25.9 per

cent of Sri Lanka’s exports, followed by the UK

(8.2 per cent) and India (6.5 per cent). Export

earnings from the USA increased by 6.0 per cent,

year-on-year, to US dollars 3,085 million in 2018,

mainly due to garments, rubber products and

machinery and mechanical appliances exports,

which accounted for about 85 per cent of total

exports to the USA. The USA continued to be

the largest single garment export destination for

Sri Lanka, accounting for about 46 per cent of total

garment exports in 2018. Exports of garments,

rubber products, machinery and mechanical

appliances, food, beverages and tobacco, tea

and chemical products to the USA increased

during the year, while exports of seafood, spices

and coconut kernel products declined. Export

earnings from the UK, the second largest export

destination, recorded a decline of 5.4 per cent,

in 2018, due to a reduction in the export of

garments, rubber products, leather, travel goods

and footwear and tea. However, textiles and other

made up textile articles, food, beverages and

tobacco, machinery and mechanical appliances,

and coconut non-kernel product exports to the

UK increased in 2018. Of the total exports to the

UK market, garments comprised 75 per cent,

which was about 15 per cent of Sri Lanka’s total

garment exports in 2018. Total exports to India,

which is the third largest buyer of Sri Lanka’s

exports, increased to US dollars 777 million in

2018 from US dollars 691 million in 2017, due

to the increase in export earnings from animal

fodder, textiles and garments, base metals and

articles, machinery and mechanical appliances,

and food beverages and tobacco. However,

spices, wood and paper products, transport

equipment and minor agricultural product

exports to India declined in 2018. Meanwhile,

exports to Germany, which accounted for 5.2

per cent of total exports, increased by 13.7 per

cent in 2018. Garments, rubber products and

machinery and mechanical appliances, which

accounted for around 66 per cent of total exports

to Germany, largely contributed to increase

export earnings from Germany in 2018. Exports

to Italy increased by 9.1 per cent in 2018, mainly

due to a rise in garment, rubber products and

seafood exports, which accounted for about

92 per cent of total exports to Italy. The EU

region, the most dominant regional market for

Sri Lankan exports, which accounted for about

29 per cent of total exports, increased by

5.3 per cent to US dollars 3,474 million in 2018.

Higher export earnings from garments, rubber

products, food, beverages and tobacco, and sea

food, which accounted for 76 per cent of total

exports to EU, largely contributed to this increase,

reflecting the positive impact of the restoration

of the EU GSP+ facility and the removal of the

ban on exports of fisheries products to the EU. In

2018, the Middle East and Russia were the main

export destinations for Sri Lanka’s tea exports.

They contributed 43.7 per cent and 10.8 per cent,

respectively, of total tea exports, despite a decline

registered in tea exports to these countries.

India continued to be the largest source of

imports although there was a reduction in its

share to 19.0 per cent of total imports in 2018

from 21.6 per cent in 2017. Import expenditure

from India declined by 6.5 per cent to US dollars

4,231 million in 2018 mainly due to lower imports

of petroleum products, building materials, vehicles,

machinery and equipment and transport equipment,

which contributed to around 44 per cent of total

imports from India. China and the UAE were the

second and third largest import origins, accounting

for 18.5 per cent and 8.3 per cent of total imports,

respectively. Main imports from China comprised

textiles and textile articles, machinery and equipment,

and building materials, which accounted for

61 per cent of total imports, while major imports from

the UAE were petroleum products and diamonds,

precious stones and metals, accounting for 87

per cent of total imports from the UAE. Japan and

Singapore were the fourth and fifth largest import

sourcing countries, accounting for 7.1 per cent and

6.2 per cent of total imports, respectively. Expenditure

on imports from Japan rose significantly by

52.6 per cent to US dollars 1,585 million in 2018,

while increasing its share of total imports to

7.1 per cent from 4.9 per cent in 2017, mainly due

to the considerable growth registered in vehicle

imports. Import expenditure on Japanese vehicles

accounted for around 62 per cent of total imports

from Japan and 62.4 per cent of vehicles imported

to Sri Lanka in 2018. Meanwhile, import expenditure

from Singapore increased marginally by 1.5 per cent

in 2018 mainly due to higher imports of petroleum

products. Diamonds, precious stones and metals,

machinery and equipment and chemical products

were the other main items imported from Singapore in

2018. However, imports of diamonds, precious stones

and metals, machinery and equipment, and chemical

products from Singapore declined during the year.

5.4 Current and Capital Account

5.4.1 Trade in Services

Trade in services recorded a notable

growth in 2018, supporting the external

current account. Earnings from tourism recorded

a strong growth, while transportation and

computer services also grew notably during 2018.

Reflecting these developments, earnings from

export of services increased by 8.4 per cent to

US dollars 8,374 million in 2018 from US dollars

7,724 million in 2017. Meanwhile, outflows on

account of services increased by 4.2 per cent to

US dollars 4,608 million during the year, stemming

from the rising demand for services in freight

transportation, passenger fares and personal

travel abroad. Accordingly, the surplus in the

services account, improved to US dollars 3,766

million in 2018 from the surplus of US dollars

3,302 million recorded in 2017.

Transport Services

The expansion of the surplus in transport

services in 2018 strengthened the services

account. Gross inflows of transportation services,

which consist of passenger fares, freight charges,

port and airport related activities, registered a

growth of 6.2 per cent, to reach US dollars 2,486

million during the year. Meanwhile, outflows of

transportation services increased by 2.9 per cent

to US dollars 1,737 million in 2018, as a result of

increased payments by domestic airlines abroad

and increased payments to non-resident shipping

lines by Sri Lankan importers. Accordingly, net

inflows from the transport sector increased to

US dollars 750 million during 2018 from US dollars

652 million in 2017.

The inflows on account of passenger

fares increased during 2018. Such increase

in passenger fares can be primarily attributed to

the increased number of passengers travelling

to Sri Lanka and increased air ticket pricing. The

earnings from passenger fares increased by

5.9 per cent to US dollars 1,227 million in 2018.

This improvement was supplemented by the

effective and timely management of aircraft

deployment and flight frequencies on the basis of

market dynamics by SriLankan Airlines. SriLankan

Airlines continued to operate to 39 destinations,

which also included higher flight frequencies to

markets such as London, Melbourne, Dubai, Abu

Dhabi, Doha and Delhi.

The earnings from freight services

increased in 2018. With the expansion in port

related activities, the inflows on account of freight

charges with respect to both port and airport

related activities increased in 2018, resulting

in a growth of 6.6 per cent to US dollars 1,260

million, reflecting increased cargo, container and

transshipment volumes handled at the port of

Colombo. During the year, the port of Colombo

marked the achievement of handling over 7 million

TEUs for the first time in history, contributing

towards the expansion of the maritime services

sector. Meanwhile, the port of Colombo was

ranked the first among the top 30 container ports

in the world, in terms of container growth for 2018

by the Alphaliner global port rankings. This is a

significant achievement as it is the first time in

history that the port of Colombo has reached the

top of a global maritime ranking.

Travel and Tourism

Earnings from tourism continued to be

a major source of foreign exchange to the

country, supported by a healthy growth in

tourist arrivals during 2018. Tourist arrivals grew

by 10.3 per cent to 2,333,796 in 2018, recording

the highest annual tourist arrivals during a year.

The endorsements and accolades received from

reputed international tourism organisations,

aggressive promotion campaigns, the significant

increase in investment in the tourism industry,

improved quality of service delivery and better

connectivity through air and sea routes mainly

contributed to the enhanced performance in the

tourism industry in 2018.

Tourist arrivals from all major regions,

except East Asia and the Middle East, increased

in 2018. Western Europe continued to be the

largest tourist origin for Sri Lanka, which grew at

23.5 per cent to 840,956 arrivals, with a share

of 36.0 per cent of total tourist arrivals. Tourist

arrivals from South Asia, the second largest tourist

origin of Sri Lanka, increased by 4.8 per cent to

543,160 arrivals. However, tourist arrivals from

South Asia, as a share of total arrivals, fell to 23.3

per cent in 2018, from 24.5 per cent in 2017. The

share of tourist arrivals from East Asia, which

increased steadily since 2011, on the back of an

impressive growth of arrivals from China up to

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

2016, also declined to 18.1 per cent, registering a

4.7 per cent decline in arrivals. However, tourist

arrivals from Australasia recorded a significant

growth of 35.9 per cent, increasing its share

in total arrivals to 5.4 per cent in 2018 from

4.3 per cent in 2017. Such a growth was mainly

driven by increased arrivals from Australia, partly

attributable to the commencement of direct flights

between Sri Lanka and Australia. On the basis of

tourist arrivals by country, India remained at the

top with 424,887 arrivals, while China remained

the second largest origin albeit recording a

marginal decline, followed by the UK, Germany

and Australia. The top five inbound tourist origins

collectively accounted for 52.0 per cent of the

total tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka in 2018. In terms

of the purpose of visit, a majority of tourists

(84.8 per cent) visited the country for leisure, while

3.1 per cent for business purposes. The share

of tourist arrivals for other purposes, such as

visiting friends and relatives, religious and cultural

purposes, health, education and sports, was

12.1 per cent of total arrivals in 2018.

Earnings from tourism recorded a healthy

growth during the year, supported by the

record high tourist arrivals and increased

average spending by tourists. Earnings

from tourism increased by 11.6 per cent to US

dollars 4,381 million in 2018, in comparison to

US dollars 3,925 million in 2017. In 2018, the

average spending per tourist rose to US dollars

173.8 per day from US dollars 170.1 per day in

2017, according to the latest annual survey on

tourist spending and duration of stay conducted

by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority

(SLTDA). Further, the average duration of stay

by a tourist was estimated at 10.8 days in 2018,

in comparison to 10.9 days in 2017. The steady

growth in tourist earnings is expected to continue

over the medium-term, complemented by targeted

promotion campaigns and continued investment

in upgrading and expanding tourism related

infrastructure in the country. Meanwhile, outflows

related to travel are also estimated to have

increased to US dollars 1,660 million, recording

an increase of 3.8 per cent in 2018. Consequently,

the surplus in the travel and tourism sub sector

increased from US dollars 2,326 million in 2017 to

US dollars 2,721 million in 2018.

Investments in the tourism sector expanded

further in 2018. During 2018, the SLTDA received

proposals for 141 hotel projects amounting to

US dollars 919 million, in comparison to 95 projects

with a total investment of US dollars 314 million

in 2017. The final approvals were granted for 44

hotel projects with 1,302 rooms in 2018, entailing

an investment worth US dollars 201 million. In

addition, 35 hotel projects have commenced

operations in 2018, adding 1,125 rooms during

this period. Meanwhile, several projects were

carried out by the SLTDA in collaboration with the

provincial councils to improve facilities in popular

tourist attractions. The Budget 2019 introduced

several tax incentives in order to reduce the

up-front costs for businesses and investments

related to the industry and facilitate refurbishment

of hotels and import of tourism related equipment.

Further, the Budget 2019 proposed to remove the

Nation Building Tax (NBT) on foreign currency

receipts by tourist hotels. The registration process

of hotels at the SLTDA is to be streamlined, thereby

encouraging the informal sector in the tourism

industry to be a part of the mainstream. Going

forward, the major priorities for the tourism industry

are the improvement of infrastructure and other

facilities, and enhancement of the skill level of the

workforce, preferably through the collaboration of

vocational training centres and industry partners.

Several policy measures were initiated

and numerous promotional campaigns were

implemented in 2018 to harness the potential of

Sri Lanka’s tourism industry. The implementation

of the new Tourism Strategic Plan (TSP)

2017-2020, which was introduced in 2017,

continued in 2018. The Sri Lanka Tourism

Promotion Bureau (SLTPB) carried out country

specific promotional activities in 34 identified

markets in 2018, including participation in trade

fairs, road shows, and consumer and food festivals.

In addition, the SLTPB strengthened the web

based promotional activities, in 2018, by continuing

visiting bloggers' programmes, online advertising

campaigns in reputed international media such

as CNN, digital advertising through web banners

and social media programmes. In support of these

promotional activities, the SLTPB launched a new

brand identity “So Sri Lanka” in November 2018.

Many travel related entities including Lonely Planet,

National Geographic have endorsed Sri Lanka as

one of the best destinations to travel to in 2019,

as a result of effective and continuous promotions

carried out by the SLTPB. Meanwhile, around

86,000 passengers from 50 cruise ships arrived at

the Colombo port. Further, several internationally

popular adventure sports events, such as Ironman

70.3 and Raid Amazons were held in Sri Lanka,

in 2018, organised by the SLTPB to promote

Sri Lanka as a diverse tourist destination in the

region. Meanwhile, several projects aimed at

increasing the safety and comfort of tourists, such

as tourist friendly tuk tuks, establishment of new

life saving units and mobile tourist police divisions,

were initiated during 2018. Cabinet approval

was granted to award the contracts for the digital

promotional campaign to position Sri Lanka as a

preferred destination in the UK, Germany, France,

India and China. Meanwhile, the SLTPB is to

support the internationally acclaimed adventure

sporting event “Adventure Racing World

Championship’’ that is scheduled to be held in

December 2019, the first international expedition

adventure race hosted by Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka’s potential in the global tourism

market remains largely untapped. Sri Lanka has

the capacity to cater to a wider tourist market, in

comparison to regional small island nations such

as Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan who are

doing exceptionally well in tourism. For example,

Singapore, being a country 91 times smaller than

Sri Lanka, catered to about 6.6 times more tourists

while earning 5 times higher in 2017. A recent study

by the United Nations World Tourism Organization

(UNWTO) specified 11 strategies and 68 measures

to understand and manage visitors’ growth in

cities. Accordingly, with the guidance of the TSP

(2017-2020) and with enhanced infrastructure and

other facilities, Sri Lanka would be able to cater to

a much higher number of tourists without reaching

the ‘carrying capacity of tourism’, which implies

the maximum number of tourists a destination can

accommodate without harming its environmental,

social and cultural resources. A coordinated

effort is needed between the government and

tourism industry stakeholders, through Public

Private Partnership (PPP) ventures, to achieve

sustainable tourism targets of the TSP by 2020. The

well-known tourists’ attractions of Sri Lanka and

some national parks become overcrowded during

the peak season, requiring smart solutions and

coordinated approaches, such as a quota based

online ticketing system, cable car system, high and

efficient public transport connectivity covering the

entire country by land, air and waterways.

Telecommunications, Computer and Information Services

The earnings from telecommunication,

computer and information services continued

it's steady growth in 2018. Total earnings from

the export of telecommunications, computer

and information services grew by 7.5 per cent

to US dollars 995 million in 2018. Earnings from

telecommunications services sub-sector increased

during the year to US dollars 147 million from

US dollars 140 million in 2017. This growth mainly

originated from increased usage of internet based

communication facilities, supported by broadband

data services as reflected in the increase in fixed

and mobile broadband subscriptions during the

year. In view of enhancing high speed connectivity

for customers, Sri Lanka Telecom PLC launched

a state-of-the-art Tier 3 Data Centre, recognised

as the “National Data Centre”, which enhances

the provision of a secure and reliable data hosting

facility and Cloud computing services in Sri Lanka.

The computer and information services

sub-sector continued its growth trend in 2018.

Accordingly, inflows to computer and information

services grew from US dollars 786 million in 2017 to

US dollars 848 million in 2018. The rapid expansion

of Information Technology Enabled Services

(ITES) that include Business Process Outsourcing

(BPO) and Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO)

continued to contribute towards the healthy growth

in this sector in addition to software development

services. In this regard, Sri Lanka unveiled the

national brand for the Sri Lankan Information

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

and Communication Technology and Business

Process Management (ICT/BPM) sector with a

tagline, “Island of Ingenuity - Sri Lanka Knowledge

Solutions” in April 2018, highlighting the ability of

Sri Lankan Information Technology (IT) companies

to deliver top quality solutions on a global scale.

It also focuses on enabling global companies to

set up Captive Innovation Centres and leverage

Sri Lanka to be the ‘Digital Gateway to Asia’.

5.4.2 Primary Income

The deficit in the primary income account

recorded a marginal increase in 2018. The

deficit in the primary income account amounted

to US dollars 2,399 million in 2018, compared to

US dollars 2,319 million in 2017, with increased

interest payments on account of ISBs and project

loans of the government and dividend payments

by direct investment enterprises (DIEs). Profitable

DIEs opted for higher dividend payments, resulting

in significantly higher dividend payments in 2018,

compared to the previous year. However, the

reinvested earnings recorded a notable decline in

2018, with the realisation of comparatively lower

profits by some large DIEs, particularly publicly

listed companies. Further, interest payments

on portfolio investments increased due to the

increase in coupon payments on ISBs issued by

the government, with coupon payments on the new

issuances of ISBs in May 2017 and April 2018 being

made during the year in addition to the coupon

payments on the ISBs issued previously. However,

coupon payments for international bond issuances

by the banking sector reduced with the maturity of

international bonds amounting to US dollars 1.35

billion in 2018. The interest payments on government

foreign loans, which constitute the main portion

under interest payments of other investments in

the primary income account, increased as a result

of the new foreign currency term financing facilities

and project loans obtained by the government. The

interest payments on foreign loans by the banking

sector increased significantly in 2018, as a result of

increased global lending rates in 2018. Meanwhile,

inflows to the primary income account increased

during the year to US dollars 262 million, primarily

due to the increase in investment income of official

reserve assets.

5.4.3 Secondary Income

Workers’ remittances continued to be

moderate in 2018, resulting in a subdued

performance of the secondary income account

during the year. Workers’ remittances, which

account for the majority of inflows in the secondary

income account, declined by 2.1 per cent to

US dollars 7,015 million in 2018 after decelerating

by 1.1 per cent in 2017. Such continued moderation

in workers’ remittances can be largely attributable

to the prevailing geopolitical uncertainties in the

Middle Eastern region, due to fluctuations in oil

prices and sluggish global growth. Further, as

per the data provided by the Sri Lanka Bureau of

Foreign Employment, overall labour migration for

foreign employment has continued its declining

trend during 2018. The decline in departures for

foreign employment can be attributed largely to

improved opportunities in the domestic labour

market and continuation of several government

measures to discourage migration of certain

categories of female unskilled labour. Meanwhile,

a marginal decline was recorded in inflows in the

form of government transfers during the year. With

these developments, inflows to the secondary

income account declined by 2.1 per cent to

US dollars 7,023 million in 2018. Meanwhile,

personal transfers and related payments by

non-residents living in Sri Lanka recorded a marginal

increase in 2018. Consequently, net inflows to the

secondary income account amounted to US dollars

6,163 million in 2018, in comparison to the net

inflow of US dollars 6,327 million recorded in the

preceding year.

Introduction

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is currently in the process of introducing a new data collecting system called the International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS), recognizing the need to implement a comprehensive cross border transactions and foreign currency transactions monitoring system through the banking sector, including Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) and Licensed Specialised Banks (LSBs). ITRS is used in many countries around the world, including regional economies in Asia such as India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.

The project is expected to aid the monitoring process of several key departments of the CBSL by ensuring the availability of timely data on inflows and outflows at a granular level of all cross-border transactions and foreign currency transactions. This is expected to facilitate an effective data reporting framework for regulatory supervision, more comprehensive compilation of external sector statistics as well as effective macroeconomic policy formulation.

1. Conceptual design and main components of an ITRS system

Data from an ITRS system mainly consists of transaction-wise data on all cross-border transactions, domestic transfers between foreign currency accounts, deposits and withdrawals from foreign currency accounts as well as cross border transactions made by non-account

BOX 6Implementation of an International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS)

holders via the banking system. The conceptual design involves development of an integrated system whereby all different types of transactions are captured and reported through a single reporting platform. The reporting platform consists of two reporting formats, namely a 'Client ITRS' and a 'Bank ITRS', as depicted in Figure B 6.1, based on a 'Closed ITRS' reporting system.

Client ITRS: A 'Client ITRS' system is expected to report all transactions of customers of the banking sector on all cross-border transactions (to both foreign currency accounts and rupee accounts) and all foreign currency transactions originating from foreign currency accounts held by customers.

Bank ITRS: The 'Bank ITRS' is expected to capture all transactions of the bank, enabled through each bank’s foreign currency Nostro accounts on a transaction-wise basis.

Closed ITRS reporting system: The reports generated through the Client ITRS and the Bank ITRS system will be reconciled with the balances of different foreign currency Nostro accounts of each commercial bank to ensure the full coverage of data reported through the total ITRS system.

Different types of transactions that initiate as cross border transactions (international transactions) and domestic transactions are categorized for ITRS reporting based on different transaction types, flows, sources of funds and types of accounts, etc used as indicated below.

• Source of funds: Foreign beneficiary; Customer’s foreign currency account; Bank’s foreign currency account; Bank’s physical cash account

A threshold limit will be used to capture some specific information regarding transactions, including the purpose of the transaction, type of the transactor and beneficiary details. The purpose of the transaction will be based on an ITRS purpose code which will be introduced alongside the ITRS reporting framework. A description of the different types of transactions which are expected to be reported through an ITRS system is described in Figure B 6.2 and Figure B 6.3.

2. The usefulness of an ITRS system

The uses of ITRS data include; providing data for regulatory supervision, obtaining data for compilation of Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics and provision of supplementary information for policy decisions.

2.1 Data reporting framework for regulatory supervision

The proposed ITRS system can be effectively used for monitoring the nature of cross border transactions and domestic foreign currency transactions through the banking system. The expected further liberalisation of

cross border capital transactions through the new Foreign Exchange Act will also go hand in hand with strengthened monitoring, as many countries have adopted ITRS during their capital account liberalisation process. Some of the expected benefits of an ITRS system for effective regulatory supervision can be highlighted as follows.

• Fulfilment of the majority of international and foreign currency related transactions data reporting requirements of the banking sector through a single platform: The proposed system will facilitate the reporting of almost all regulatory reporting requirements of domestic banking units (DBU) and off-shore banking units (OBUs) through a single data reporting platform. The proposed system will avoid duplication of the reporting of similar data for different regulatory requirements.

• Timely and secured reporting of regulatory data reports: The new platform will ensure timely and secured reporting of regulatory data with higher frequencies with more sophisticated error detection criteria. It is expected to ease the burden of commercial banks in reporting data while ensuring more detailed, comprehensive data is reported for regulatory purposes. The data reported through the ITRS system can be used for strengthening the Anti Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism regimes as well.

• Ease of accommodating new amendments to regulatory requirements and new regulatory reporting: The proposed system can be effectively used for new amendments of existing regulatory requirements and to accommodate new regulatory reporting of international transactions and domestic transactions facilitated through foreign currency accounts.

• Verification of effectiveness of current regulations: The system can be effectively used for verification of the effectiveness of regulations adopted with regard to foreign currency related transactions. This will aid in making appropriate changes to existing policies and in adopting new policies when necessary.

• Monitoring reporting of export proceeds: The ITRS system could be used in conjunction with data from Sri Lanka Customs to monitor the requirement for exporters to repatriate their export proceeds within a certain period, as per the regulations issued under the Foreign Exchange Act.

• More customer oriented database for commercial banks for targeted research and marketing: Commercial banks will also benefit from improving their databases for more customer and transaction purpose oriented data gathering and analysing.

2.2 Compilation of Balance of Payments Statistics

The ITRS data will be primarily used to supplement the compilation of BOP statistics. This is achieved by aggregating data based on the purpose of the transaction. The ITRS system will use a unique purpose code system which is in line with the international standardized reporting categories in BOP statistics. The ITRS would be the major source in identifying recipients and senders of specific types of transactions that need to be further monitored through direct surveys. All major types of transactions in the services account can be compiled through an ITRS system. Some improvements in the compilation of BOP statistics envisaged through the implementation of an ITRS system are highlighted below.

• Overall improvement in BOP statistics: The proposed system is expected to significantly improve the BOP statistical compilation framework in terms of data coverage. The new data is expected to identify different types of potential transactions which should be included in the BOP compilation process. The data from the ITRS system will potentially be used for selected transaction types in the Services, Primary Income and Secondary Income accounts while supplementing existing surveys in the Financial Account of the BOP.

• Enhanced coverage of the services sector: All major types of transactions in the services account can be compiled through an ITRS system. The statistics of the services account is currently being compiled by estimations based on annual and bi-annual surveys. The quality of such data can be significantly improved through an ITRS system. The specific areas include receipts of the IT/BPO sector, expenses by Sri Lankans traveling abroad, transportation, telecommunications and insurance services. Moreover, data on emerging services sub sectors such as research and development, consultancy, patent rights and other such service transactions can also be covered under an ITRS system.

• Enhanced coverage of current external sector surveys: The ITRS system will significantly enhance the coverage of existing surveys, particularly the surveys conducted on the Financial Account of the BOP. The ITRS system could effectively be used

5.5 Current Account Balance

The current account deficit widened

significantly in 2018. The current account deficit

widened as a result of a significant expansion of the

trade deficit, deficit in the primary income account

and a marginal decline in the secondary income

balance, despite a notable increase in the services

account. Although merchandise exports recorded a

satisfactory growth during the year, the trade deficit

widened due to the higher growth in imports. The

upsurge in import expenditure was mainly driven

by personal motor vehicles, gold and fuel imports.

The surplus in the services account continued

to develop the potential survey framework by identifying all related transactions relating to the specific financial account transactions.

• Improved statistics on workers’ remittances: With the introduction of the new Foreign Exchange Act, all Resident Foreign Currency (RFC) and non-resident Foreign Currency (NRFC) accounts have been amalgamated to Personal Foreign Currency Accounts (PFCA) along with other non-workers’ remittances related transactions. The new system will capture workers’ remittances flows separately in accordance with the newly introduced Foreign Exchange Act. The proposed ITRS system will be beneficial in obtaining both inward and outward workers’ remittances flows.

• Data inputs to National Account Statistics: The improvements in the BOP statistical framework will also facilitate more granular level data for compilation of the national accounts by the Department of Census and Statistics.

2.3 Supporting information for macroeconomic policy making

Data from an ITRS system could also be used as supporting information for macroeconomic policy decisions. The ITRS system can complement macroeconomic policy making in the following manner.

• Provide early warning signals on external imbalances: The ITRS system facilitates retrieval of real time data on cross border transactions. For example, data on foreign investments in real estate/ condominium sectors can be obtained from an ITRS system thus enabling to identify the possibility of any real estate bubbles created by foreign investments.

• Providing inputs to assess the viability of policy initiatives: In order to save time and resources, it is important to assess the feasibility of policy initiatives before they are implemented. An ITRS system serves this purpose as it provides a comprehensive coverage of data on a timely and frequent manner. For example, information on potential saving of foreign exchange by establishing local branches of foreign universities can be obtained through an ITRS system.

• Facilitating to ensure financial system stability: Through the data obtained from the ITRS system, most vulnerable sectors with liquidity issues in domestic foreign exchange market could be identified, thereby providing data inputs to policy decisions on ensuring the financial system stability.

3. ITRS Implementation Framework

The introduction of the ITRS reporting system to commercial banks is expected to commence in the second half of 2019 and it is expected to be fully implemented by the first half of 2020. The Central Bank is currently in the process of designing ITRS reporting requirements and the initial drafting of the regulatory framework.

The lead collaborative departments of the CBSL are currently conducting technical level discussions on the implementation of the ITRS system, taking into consideration the existing reporting channels and technical infrastructure. Going forward, the CBSL will introduce the system to the banking sector and coordinate closely with the banking sector in the processes of introducing reporting requirements, upgrading the IT systems of banks and providing required training to bank staff.

its positive momentum during 2018 with a strong

growth in earnings from tourism, transport and

computer services sub-sectors. The deficit in the

primary income account widened marginally during

the year with increased dividends and interest

payments and a notable decline in reinvested

earnings of DIEs. The current account was further

burdened by the decline in workers’ remittances

during the year. Consequently, the current account

deficit widened to US dollars 2,814 million in 2018,

in comparison to US dollars 2,309 million in 2017.

As a percentage of GDP, the current account

deficit, in 2018, was 3.2 per cent, in comparison to

2.6 per cent in 2017.

5.6 Capital Account Balance

The inflows to the capital account remained

subdued in 2018. Capital transfers to the

government declined, while those to the private

sector recorded an improvement, in 2018, in

comparison to the previous year. Consequently,

the capital account recorded a surplus of US dollars

14 million in 2018 compared to a surplus of

US dollars 11 million in 2017.

5.7 Financial Account

The net incurrence of liabilities and net

acquisition of assets decreased in 2018,

compared to 2017. Nevertheless, the significant

inflows to the financial account outweighed

outflows, resulting in an accretion of liabilities on

a net basis during 2018. During the year, major

inflows to the financial account were the issuance

of two ISBs of US dollars 2.5 billion, the foreign

currency term financing facility of US dollars

1 billion and FDI inflows of US dollars 2.1 billion,

which includes foreign loans to BOI companies.

Major outflows from the financial account consisted

of maturity of international bonds issued by

the banking sector, amounting to US dollars

1.35 billion, and net outflows from the rupee

denominated government securities market of

US dollars 990 million. Meanwhile, depletion of

gross official reserves amidst intervention in the

domestic foreign exchange market and foreign

debt service payments by the government led to

a considerable decline in the net acquisition of

assets during the year. Accordingly, net incurrence

of liabilities amounted to US dollars 2,737 million,

while net acquisition of assets declined by US dollars

591 million in 2018. During the first four months of

2018, relatively stable conditions prevailed in the

domestic foreign exchange market, enabling the

Central Bank to absorb foreign exchange from

the domestic foreign exchange market to build up

external buffers. This, together with the proceeds

from two ISBs issued by the government amounting

to US dollars 2.5 billion, in April 2018, complemented

the build up of gross official reserves to a record

high level of US dollars 9.9 billion as at end April

2018. However, the tightening of global financial

market conditions and the resultant reversal of

capital flows from the government securities market

and the CSE exerted significant pressure on the

domestic foreign exchange market, requiring the

Central Bank to supply foreign exchange to the

market since end April 2018. These developments,

together with the outflows on account of foreign

debt service payments, resulted in the gross official

reserves declining to US dollars 6.9 billion, while

the overall balance recorded a deficit of US dollars

1,103 million at end 2018.

5.7.1 Direct Investment

FDI, including foreign borrowings of BOI

companies, increased considerably, reaching

the historically highest level in 2018. Total FDI

inflows, inclusive of foreign loans received by

companies registered with the BOI, amounted to

US dollars 2,136 million, in 2018, in comparison

to US dollars 1,910 million in 2017. Meanwhile,

FDI, excluding foreign loans obtained by BOI

companies, also increased notably to US dollars

1,611 million, in 2018, from US dollars 1,373 million

in 2017. FDI inflows, excluding foreign loans to BOI

companies, comprised US dollars 1,148 million of

net intercompany debt, US dollars 225 million of

reinvested earnings and US dollars 238 million of

net investments in equity during the year. A notable

reduction in reinvested earnings was recorded in

2018 compared to the previous year implying

relatively less profits declared by DIEs during the

year. In addition, there were a significant repayment

of intercompany debt amounting to US dollars

426 million in 2018, negatively impacting net FDI

inflows during the year. Foreign loans obtained by

BOI companies from non-related parties amounted

to US dollars 525 million, in 2018, compared to

US dollars 538 million in 2017. FDI inflows in

2018 were mainly received by the Hambantota

International Port Group (Pvt) Ltd, amounting to

US dollars 828 million, of which US dollars 682

million was received by the government as

proceeds of the long lease of Hambantota

port during the year. In 2018, FDI inflows were

channeled largely to projects related to ports,

telecommunications, housing and property

development and hotels, while FDI inflows to

the manufacturing sector remained moderate.

Based on the country of immediate investor, the

top five source countries of FDI in 2018 were

China, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia and the United

Kingdom. Meanwhile, direct investments made by

Sri Lankan companies in foreign countries, which

resulted in a net acquisition of assets, amounted

to US dollars 68 million, in 2018, in comparison to

US dollars 72 million in 2017.

5.7.2 Portfolio Investment

Equity

Portfolio investments in equity, which reflect

foreign equity investment inflows excluding

direct investments, recorded a marginal net

outflow in 2018. Portfolio investments in equity

consist of foreign investments in the CSE other

than direct investment transactions, and account

for investments by non-residents, holding less than

10 per cent of the total shareholding of a Sri Lankan

enterprise. Reflecting the subdued global investor

appetite in capital markets of emerging economies,

portfolio investment in the form of equity recorded

a net outflow of US dollars 4 million in 2018. This

comprised a net outflow of US dollars 82 million

from the secondary market and an inflow of

US dollars 78 million to the primary market. There

was a sharp moderation of net inflows to the CSE in

2018, in comparison to 2017 which recorded a net

foreign inflow to the CSE amounting to US dollars

359 million, including net inflows to the secondary

market amounting to US dollars 202 million and

primary market inflows amounting to US dollars

157 million.

Debt Securities

The issuance of two ISBs by the

government, which represented the largest

annual offshore bond offering by Sri Lanka,

was the major inflow on account of debt

securities, while a number of international

bonds issued by the banking sector matured

in 2018. Successful issuance of two ISBs with

5 year and 10 year maturities valued each at

US dollars 1.25 billion in April 2018, marked

Sri Lanka’s twelfth US dollar benchmark offering

in the international bond markets since 2007.

These ISBs were priced well within the initial

price guidance reflecting continued investor

confidence in Sri Lanka. With the policy rate

hikes of the Federal Reserve Bank, there were

significant outflows of foreign investment from

the government securities market. Accordingly,

foreign investment in Treasury Bonds and

Treasury Bills recorded net outflows amounting

to US dollars 894 million and US dollars

96 million, respectively, in 2018. Meanwhile,

foreign investments in Sri Lanka Development

Bonds (SLDB) also recorded a net outflow of

US dollars 26 million in 2018. The main outflow

with respect to debt securities, during 2018,

was the maturity of several international bonds

totaling US dollars 1,350 million issued by the

banking sector, which included US dollars 500

million issued by the Bank of Ceylon, US dollars

750 million issued by the National Savings Bank

and US dollars 100 million issued by the DFCC

Bank.

5.7.3 Other Investment

Currency and Deposits

Currency and deposits in the form of assets

increased, while the currency and deposit

liabilities recorded a notable decline in 2018.

This was mainly due to the increase in assets

and decrease in liabilities related to currency

and deposits of deposit taking corporations.

Accordingly, currency and deposits in the form of

assets of deposit taking corporations increased by

US dollars 80 million, while currency and deposit

liabilities declined by US dollars 632 million in

2018. The notable decline in currency and deposits

liabilities of the banking sector could possibly be

due to the significant pressure in the domestic

foreign exchange market, which may have reduced

deposit liabilities of non-residents held with

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

commercial banks and may also be due to possible reduction in export proceeds, particularly in the latter part of 2018.

Loans

Net loan inflows to the financial account moderated in 2018. The reduction in net loan

inflows was mainly due to reduced net loan

inflows to the government, while short-term foreign

loans obtained by the banking sector recorded a

significant increase during the year. Accordingly,

the net inflow of loans to the financial account

amounted to US dollars 1,568 million in 2018,

compared to US dollars 1,889 million in 2017.

Net foreign loan inflows to the government

moderated due to significant repayments of

foreign loans during 2018. The net foreign loan

inflows to the government amounted to US dollars

558 million, in 2018, compared to US dollars

1,223 million in 2017. This comprised US dollars

2,329 million of foreign loan disbursements and

US dollars 1,771 million of foreign loan repayments

during the year. Of the total foreign loan

disbursements, US dollars 1,204 million was on

account of project loans, US dollars 1,000 million

was a foreign currency term financing facility and

US dollars 125 million was for programme loans.

Major project loan inflows to the government,

in 2018, included the loans obtained for the

Construction of Extension of Southern Expressway

Section 1 from Matara to Beliatta Project,

Construction of Outer Circular Highway Project

Phase III from Kerawalapitiya to Kadawatha, New

Bridge Construction Project over the Kelani River

and Integrated Road Investment Program - Tranche

3. The foreign currency term financing facility was

obtained from the China Development Bank, while

the programme loan was obtained from the Asian

Development Bank. In terms of loan repayments,

US dollars 1,158 million was on account of

repayment of foreign project loans, while US dollars

613 million was for repayment of foreign currency

term financing facilities. The government’s foreign

loan repayment obligations have increased over

the years, resulting in a gradual decline in foreign

loans to the government on a net basis.

Foreign loans obtained by deposit taking

corporations, private corporations and State

Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) and

the Central Bank also recorded a net inflow in

2018. Net foreign loan inflows to deposit taking

corporations, which consist of licensed commercial

banks (LCBs), licensed specialised banks (LSBs)

and licensed finance companies (LFCs) amounted

to US dollars 697 million, compared to US dollars

271 million in 2017. This increase was mainly driven

by significant increase in short-term loan inflows

to the banking sector. Further, the net foreign

loan inflows to the other sector amounted to US

dollars 61 million, which consisted of loan inflows of

US dollars 657 million to private corporations, while

no foreign loans were received by SOBEs during

the year. The total foreign loan repayments by

the private corporations and SOBEs amounted to

US dollars 596 million, which consisted of foreign

loans repayment of US dollars 186 million by SOBEs

and US dollars 410 million by private corporations.

Meanwhile, foreign loans to the Central Bank

recorded a net inflow of US dollars 252 million with

the receipt of the fifth tranche under the IMF-EFF

during the year.

Trade Credit and Advances and Other Accounts Receivable / Payable

Trade credit and advances received by

residents as well as trade credit and advances

given to non-residents increased in 2018. Trade

credits received, of which a major component was

received by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

(CPC), increased during 2018. This resulted

in an increase of net incurrence of liabilities of

trade credits received by US dollars 224 million,

compared to an increase of US dollars 195 million

in 2017, mainly driven by higher fuel imports during

the year. Meanwhile, the net acquisition of assets

on trade credit and advances, which represent

trade credits given by Sri Lankan exporters to

their overseas trading partners and deposit taking

corporations, increased to US dollars 148 million

in 2018, compared to an increase of US dollars

35 million in 2017. Further, other accounts payable,

mainly consisting of Asian Clearing Union (ACU)

liabilities managed by the Central Bank, recorded

a net decrease of US dollars 162 million, while

other accounts receivable of LCBs recorded a net

increase of US dollars 116 million in 2018.

during 2018. Reserve transactions declined by

US dollars 1,002 million in 2018, on a net basis,

compared to the significant increase of US dollars

2,784 million recorded in 2017. During the year,

currency and deposits of the Central Bank reduced

by US dollars 1,012 million while the Central Bank’s

investment in foreign debt securities increased by

US dollars 122 million. Further, the Central Bank

reduced its monetary gold holdings by a net sale of

US dollars 103 million during 2018.

5.8 Overall Balance

The overall balance, which reflects the

change in net international reserves during the

period under review, recorded a deficit in 2018.

The overall balance recorded a deficit of US dollars

1,103 million in 2018, in contrast to the surplus of

US dollars 2,068 million recorded in 2017. Despite

significant inflows to the financial account during the

year in terms of proceeds of the two ISBs, receipt

of the foreign currency term financing facility and

proceeds from the long lease of Hambantota port,

net international reserves declined to US dollars

5,495 million as at end 2018, from US dollars 6,597

million as at end 2017, mainly due to continued

foreign currency debt service payments and the

net supply of foreign exchange by the Central Bank

to the domestic foreign exchange market in 2018.

5.9 International Investment

Position

Sri Lanka’s external liability position

increased, while the external asset position

declined as at end 2018. The total foreign asset

position declined to US dollars 12,065 million

from US dollars 12,704 million as at end 2017,

primarily due to the reduction in the reserve

asset position, despite an increase in asset

positions in direct investments, currency and

deposits and trade credits and advances given to

non-residents. Sri Lanka’s total liability position

to non-residents increased to US dollars 62,486

million as at end 2018, an increase of US dollars

1.9 billion from the beginning of the year. This

increase was primarily due to the rise in direct

investment stock position and the outstanding

foreign liabilities of commercial banks and the

government, compared to the beginning of the

year. With these developments, Sri Lanka’s net

international investment position, which takes

into consideration the difference between the total

external asset and liability positions, deteriorated

from a net liability position of US dollars 47,857

million at end 2017 to a net liability position of

US dollars 50,421 million at end 2018. This

gradual build-up of Sri Lanka’s net liability position

is mainly driven by the increase in outstanding

external debt of the government and the gradual

build-up of the direct investment liability position

of DIEs.

5.9.1 Direct Investment Position

The direct investment asset position as

well as the direct investment liability position

increased in 2018. The direct investment liability

position increased to US dollars 12,757 million as at

end 2018, compared to US dollars 10,755 million as

at end 2017, with noteworthy inflows of FDI to BOI

companies and the proceeds from the long lease of

the Hambantota Port during the year. There was a

significant negative impact to the direct investment

liability position due to valuation losses of publicly

listed direct investment enterprises. Further, there

were notable debt to equity swap transactions of

some major corporates, resulting in an increase

in equity positions with an equal reduction in

debt positions of these companies. Meanwhile,

there were key mergers of some large corporates

with significant direct investments, resulting in

consolidation of equity and debt positions of these

companies as well. Despite a significant reduction

in debt positions due to debt to equity swaps of some

large DIEs, the liability position of debt instruments

of DIEs increased overall, reflecting the increase

in advances by direct investors. The top five

sources in terms of direct investment liability stock

position as at end 2018 were China, Netherlands,

India, Singapore and Malaysia. Meanwhile, the

direct investment asset position which represents

direct investments abroad by Sri Lankan residents

stood at US dollars 1,433 million as at end 2018,

compared to US dollars 1,375 million as at end

2017.

5.9.2 Portfolio Investment Position

The portfolio investment liability position

reduced in 2018. With significant reduction

in market prices of outstanding government

ISBs, outflows of foreign investments from the

Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds market, and

a number of maturities of international debt

securities of the banking sector, the outstanding

portfolio investment liability position declined as

at end 2018, despite the issuance of the two ISBs

by the government. Accordingly, the portfolio

investment liability stock position declined to

US dollars 14,629 million as at end 2018, from

US dollars 15,620 million as at end 2017. The

portfolio investment equity position increased to

US dollars 1,824 million by end 2018, compared

to US dollars 1,533 million as at end 2017.

Meanwhile, portfolio investment debt securities

position recorded a notable decline to US dollars

12,805 million by the end 2018, compared to

US dollars 14,087 million as at end 2017. This

was mainly due to a significant reduction in

market prices of the currently outstanding ISBs

as at end December 2018, possibly as a result

of investor sentiment in secondary markets due

to the political uncertainty in the latter part of

2018. Due to the deteriorated market sentiment,

secondary market yields of the outstanding ISBs

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

179

5

increased notably, also resulting in a significant

decline in the market prices of the existing ISBs.

Despite the increase in outstanding liability

position of ISBs issued by the government

with the issuance of new ISBs during the year,

significant outflows from rupee denominated

government securities and SLDBs held by non-

residents as well as the reduction in market

prices of existing ISBs resulted in a moderation

of the increase in outstanding total government

debt securities held by non-residents as at end

2018. Meanwhile, the debt security liability

position of deposit taking corporations recorded

a significant decline by the end of the year due

to the settlement of international bonds issued

by several banks, amounting to US dollars 1,350

million.

5.9.3 Other Investment Position

Currency and Deposits

The currency and deposits asset position

increased marginally, while the liability position

recorded a notable decline as at end 2018.

The currency and deposit liability position of

deposit taking corporations declined to US dollars

1,581 million as at end 2018, from US dollars 2,213

million recorded as at end 2017, primarily with

the reduction in deposit liabilities of non-residents

and exporters. The currency and deposits asset

position, which comprises the asset position of the

deposit taking corporations, increased marginally to

US dollars 864 million as at end 2018, from

US dollars 784 million at the beginning of the year.

Loans

The foreign loan liability position in the IIP

increased as at end 2018. The total outstanding

loan liabilities increased due to the increase in the

foreign loan liability position across all the sectors

including the government, the Central Bank, deposit

taking corporations and the other sector that comprise

the private sector and SOBEs. Consequently, the

foreign loan liability position increased to US dollars

30,382 million as at end 2018 from US dollars 28,884

million as at end 2017. The increase in the foreign

loan liability position of the government to US dollars

19,623 million was a result of new project loans, a

new programme loan and the new foreign currency

term financing facility obtained by the government.

The outstanding foreign loans of deposit taking

corporations increased with an increase in short

term foreign loans. The outstanding loan liability

position of the private sector recorded a moderate

increase with an increase in foreign loans of some

major corporates and BOI companies while the

liability position of SOBEs declined as a result of debt

repayments and no new loan disbursements during

2018. The outstanding liability position of the Central

Bank increased with the receipt of the fifth tranche of

the IMF-EFF facility.

Trade Credit and Advances

The trade credit and advances asset position

as well as the liability position increased in

2018. The outstanding trade credit and advances

liability position, which consists of trade credit

and advances of the private sector and SOBEs,

increased from US dollars 1,930 million as at end

2017 to US dollars 2,154 million as at end 2018,

mainly due to the increase in outstanding trade

credits of the CPC. Meanwhile, the outstanding

asset position of trade credit and advances, which

reflects the trade credit and advances given by

deposit taking corporations and the private sector

increased to US dollars 1,150 million as at end

2018, from US dollars 1,002 million as at end 2017.

Other Accounts Receivable / Payable and Special Drawing Rights

The outstanding position of other accounts

receivable increased while other accounts

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

180

5

payable declined in 2018. The outstanding

position of other accounts receivable of deposit

taking corporations increased to US dollars 1,700

million as at end 2018 from US dollars 1,584

million as at end 2017. Meanwhile, the outstanding

position of other accounts payable declined to

US dollars 432 million as at end 2018, with a

reduction in ACU related liabilities of the Central

Bank. Further, the outstanding Special Drawing

Rights (SDR) liability position declined marginally

to US dollars 550 million, with changes in the

exchange rate as at end 2018.

5.9.4 Reserve Asset Position

Sri Lanka’s gross official reserve assets

position declined as at end 2018 to US dollars

6.9 billion from US dollars 8.0 billion recorded

at end 2017. The level of gross official reserves of

the country at end-2018 was equivalent to finance

3.7 months of imports of goods. The relatively stable

domestic foreign exchange market conditions

enabled the Central Bank to absorb US dollars 459

million from the market on a net basis during the

first four months of the year. This, together with the

proceeds from two ISBs issued by the government

totaling US dollars 2.5 billion in April 2018

supplemented the build up of gross official reserves

to reach a record high level of US dollars 9.9 billion

at end April 2018. In addition, proceeds from the

long lease of the Hambantota port, receipt of the

fifth tranche of the IMF-EFF and proceeds of the

foreign currency term financing facility supported

the accumulation of gross official reserves during

the year. However, the tightening of global financial

conditions and the resultant reversal of capital

flows from the government securities market

and the CSE exerted significant pressure on the

domestic foreign exchange market, requiring the

Central Bank to supply foreign exchange to the

market since end April 2018. These developments,

together with outflows on account of foreign debt

service payments caused the gross official reserves

to decline to US dollars 6.9 billion by end 2018.

The gross official reserves were sufficient to cover

50 per cent of the country’s short-term debt and

liabilities as at end-2018. Meanwhile, total foreign

assets, which consist of gross official reserves

and foreign assets of deposit taking corporations,

also decreased to US dollars 9.6 billion at end

2018, which is equivalent to finance 5.2 months of

imports, from US dollars 10.4 billion as at end-2017.

This decline was primarily due to the depletion of

gross official reserves, while foreign assets of the

banking sector remained at similar levels by end

2018, compared to end 2017.

5.10 External Debt and Debt Servicing

5.10.1 External Debt

Sri Lanka’s outstanding external debt

increased by US dollars 706 million in 2018.

Sri Lanka’s total outstanding external debt increased

to US dollars 52,310 million by end 2018 from US

dollars 51,604 million by end 2017, mainly due to the

increase in the external debt of the general government,

private sector corporations and DIEs. The increase

in government’s external debt by US dollars 654

million during 2018 reflects the impact of repayment

of project loans, foreign investment outflows from the

government securities market despite the issuance of

new ISBs during the year. The government’s external

borrowings were mainly financed by the issuance of

two ISBs totalling US dollars 2.5 billion, project loan

inflows of US dollars 1.2 billion and foreign currency

term financing facility of US dollars 1 billion during

the year. Meanwhile, the Central Bank received the

fifth tranche of the IMF - EFF while the outstanding

liabilities with the ACU managed by the Central Bank

decreased compared to the beginning of the year.

A notable decrease in the outstanding external debt

of deposit taking corporations was observed as a

result of the maturity of outstanding international

bonds by the Bank of Ceylon, National Savings

Bank and the DFCC Bank, amounting to US dollars

1.35 billion during 2018. Outstanding external debt of

SOBEs recorded a notable increase with the increase

in trade credits of the CPC during 2018 despite

significant repayments of foreign loans by other

SOBEs. Further, intercompany borrowing of DIEs

recorded an increase of around US dollars 1.1 billion

during 2018, with a number of major DIEs in ports,

telecommunications and hotels sectors receiving

intercompany loans and shareholder advances

during the year.

The total outstanding external debt of the

country as a percentage of GDP remained at

similar levels during 2018. The total outstanding

external debt as a percentage of GDP stood at 58.7

per cent by end 2018, compared to 58.6 per cent by

end 2017, as the modest increase in outstanding

external debt remained similar to the increase in

nominal GDP during 2018. The total external debt

with long term maturity also remained at similar

levels by end 2018, compared to the beginning

of the year. Further, the outstanding government

foreign debt, which remains the largest portion of

the total external debt, increased to 61.2 per cent of

total external debt by end 2018 compared to 60.8

per cent at end 2017.

5.10.2 Foreign Debt Service

Payments

Sri Lanka’s external debt service payments

increased in 2018 with higher capital repayments

and interest payments. Capital repayments on

external debt increased to US dollars 4,188 million

in 2018, compared to US dollars 3,167 million

in 2017 with significant repayments of foreign

liabilities by the government, the banking sector,

private corporations and SOBEs. Debt servicing of

the government recorded a notable increase with

the repayment of foreign currency term financing

facilities amounting to US dollars 613 million and

project loan repayments of US dollars 1,158 million

during 2018. Further, the banking sector repaid

US dollars 1,350 million of international bonds

which matured during the year. Capital repayments

of foreign loans by the private sector and SOBEs

also recorded a significant increase during the

year. The interest payments on outstanding total

external debt increased to US dollars 1,678 million

in 2018, compared to US dollars 1,399 million in

2017. The increase in interest payments was

mainly due to the increase in interest payments of

the government due to larger coupon payments of

ISBs and interest payments on foreign loans by

the government. The increased interest payments

by government, commercial banks and the private

sector could also be attributed to the increase in

global interest rates triggered by the interest rate

hikes of the Federal Reserve Bank of the United

States. Meanwhile, total external debt service as a

percentage of exports of merchandise goods and

services increased during 2018. The increase in

debt service payments outweighed the increase

in the growth of export of merchandise goods and

services, resulting in total external debt service as

a percentage of exports of merchandise goods and

services increasing to 28.9 per cent in 2018 from

23.9 per cent in 2017.

Sri Lanka would likely face significant challenges

in foreign debt servicing in the medium term. With

annual external debt repayment commitments being

around US dollars 4 to 5 billion from 2019 onwards,

there is a significant borrowing need in the form of

ISBs and other financing facilities from international

financial markets. The cost of such borrowings

could also be higher with the possibility of rising

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

183

global interest rates in the medium term. A long-term

approach to rebalance the current account as well

as to ensure more non-debt creating inflows in the

form of FDIs and equity investments to the financial

account would be needed to keep foreign borrowings

at sustainable levels.

5.11 Exchange Rate Movements

The exchange rate, which remained

relatively stable during the first four months

of 2018, came under significant pressure

thereafter, particularly during the latter

part of 2018. During the first four months, the

influx of foreign exchange to the domestic

foreign exchange market enabled the Central

Bank to absorb foreign exchange amounting to

US dollars 459 million, on a net basis. However,

this favourable condition was reversed since

May 2018 onwards, as a result of both external

and domestic factors. On the external front, the

strengthening of the US economy prompted

an increase in the policy rate of the Federal

Reserve Bank, accompanied by the expectation

of a number of possible interest rate hikes for

2018 and 2019. These developments resulted

in continuous foreign investment outflows from

the government securities market and the CSE,

resulting in low liquidity levels in the domestic

foreign exchange market. On the domestic front,

an increased demand for foreign exchange by

importers, lack of dollar conversions by exporters

and unfavourable political developments

contributed to the depreciation of the rupee,

particularly in the latter part of 2018. With the

Central Bank allowing greater flexibility in the

exchange rate, the exchange rate was permitted

to depreciate in line with market fundamentals,

while intervening in the domestic foreign

exchange market by providing liquidity only to

mitigate excessive volatility of the exchange

rate. This resulted in the Central Bank supplying

US dollars 1,120 million on a net basis to the

foreign exchange market during 2018, while the

Sri Lankan rupee depreciating against the US

dollar by 16.4 per cent during the year.

Other major currencies depreciated

against the US dollar in line with the

broad-based strengthening of the US dollar,

amidst rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve

Bank. Accordingly, the exchange rate of the

Sri Lankan rupee depreciated against the euro by

12.68 per cent, the Indian rupee by 8.72 per cent, the

Japanese yen by 18.05 per cent, and the pound

sterling by 11.35 per cent. With the combined

1. Introduction

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has been preparing the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) and Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indices based on 5-currency and 24-currency baskets since 1989 with periodical revisions introduced to the base year. The effective exchange rate indices1 are revised regularly since the relative share of bilateral trade between certain countries could vary over time. For instance, the European Central Bank and Bank for International Settlements update base periods of their REER indices every three years. The base year of Sri Lanka’s existing REER and NEER indices was 2010, and it was brought forward to 2017 to better reflect any changes in the relative share of trading partners. Following the base year revision to 2017, the current indices of 5-currency and 24-currency NEER and REER are calculated backward to start from January 2013 onwards.

2. Selection of the Base Year

The base year of NEER and REER reflect the contemporary trade patterns through the relative weights assigned for each country. As such, it is necessary to have the base year periodically updated in order to maintain realistic weights. When choosing the base year for determining the relative weights, several factors need to be considered, such as reflecting the recent trade patterns and stability in the exchange rates. If the structure of the foreign trade of a country is subject to frequent changes, updating should be made in shorter time intervals. When comparing the trade weights based on Sri Lanka’s bilateral trade with trading partners between 2010 and 2017, some notable changes are observed. For instance, the relative share of Sri Lanka’s bilateral trade with China and India has increased, while the relative share of Sri Lanka’s bilateral trade with the UK, Belgium,

BOX 7Rebasing of the Real Effective Exchange Rate

France, Germany and Hong Kong has reduced during the period from 2010 to 2017. The increase in bilateral trade share with China was mainly due to the increase in imports of textiles, machinery, building materials and telecommunication devices, while the increase in bilateral trade share with India was mainly due to the increase in imports of textiles, machinery, building materials and vehicles. The relative share of bilateral trade with most of other countries has been adjusted accordingly [the revised trade weights are shown in Table B 7.1]. Therefore, rebasing the NEER and REER from 2010 to 2017 would adequately capture the change in trade patterns with trading partners over time. With regard to the exchange rate, the year should not have experienced excessive volatility. Hence, the year 2017 was considered to be more appropriate, where the exchange rate remained relatively stable.

1The effective exchange rate measures the value of a currency against a basket of other currencies and is generally expressed as an index. Typically, the basket of foreign currencies comprises the currencies at major trading partners of the reference country. The NEER is the weighted geometric average of major bilateral nominal exchange rates, with weights based on the proportion of bilateral trade in Sri Lanka’s total foreign trade: ܰܧܧܴൌςሾ݁௜ሿ௪೔௡௜ୀଵ, where ei = exchange rate of the foreign currency i against the home currency in indexed form, wi = trade weights, n = no. of countries in the basket. The REER is obtained by adjusting the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate for inflation differentials between domestic and respective foreign countries and used as an indicator of the country’s external competitiveness. The REER index is typically used as an indicator of export competitiveness or currency

3. Implications of the Rebasing of the REER

The Figure B 7.1 compares the REER index based on the previous base year of 2010 and the revised base year of 2017. As the Figure shows, the base year revision leads to a downward shift in the newly calculated REER in parallel to the previous index as the trend in both indices remains broadly intact. The downward shift in the REER with the rebasing to 2017 indicates that the real exchange rate in 2017 was more competitive than it was reflected in the base year of 2010. Further, the relatively parallel shift reflects the fact that, the methodology and underlying assumptions on calculating the REER were kept the same, while the trade weights between 2017 and 2010 have not changed significantly for majority of trading partners.

selected major currencies together with the

movements in cross currency exchange rates.

Accordingly, the 5-currency NEER index

depreciated by 12.74 per cent, while the

24-currency index depreciated by 11.69 per cent in

2018. Meanwhile, the 5-currency and 24-currency

REER indices, which indicate Sri Lanka’s external

competitiveness implied by the inflation differential

between countries along with the variation in nominal

exchange rates, also dropped during the year, by

12.46 per cent and 11.60 per cent, respectively.

REER indices remained predominantly below the

base year level in 2018, indicating the continued

competitiveness of the Sri Lankan rupee.

5.11.2 Developments in the Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

In 2018, the spot market continued to

remain active in response to the more market-

based exchange rate policy, while the volume

of forward transactions declined. With the

increase in spot market transactions, the total

volume of transactions in the domestic foreign

exchange market increased during the year to

US dollars 17,402 million, from US dollars 16,451

million in 2017. The volume of spot transactions

increased markedly to US dollars 10,770 million

(61.9 per cent of total transactions) in 2018 from

US dollars 8,426 million in 2017. However, the

total volume of forward transactions decreased to

US dollars 6,632 million in 2018 from US dollars

8,025 million in 2017. Meanwhile, the intervention by

the Central Bank in the domestic foreign exchange

market during the year resulted in a supply of

US dollars 1,120 million, on a net basis, in 2018.

This included a supply of US dollars 1,677 million

and an absorption of US dollars 557 million. In

contrast, during 2017 the Central Bank purchased

foreign exchange liquidity amounting to US dollars

2,214 million while supplying US dollars 550

million. The higher level of net supply in 2018 was

due to the increase in foreign exchange outflows

particularly in the second half of the year, which

necessitated the Central Bank’s intervention in

supplying liquidity to the foreign exchange market

to stabilise the Sri Lankan rupee.

5.12 External Sector Outlook

The external sector outlook in 2019 remains

positive despite some downside risks. The

deficit in the trade account is expected to contract

during 2019 with the anticipated deceleration in

imports supported by the changes introduced in

the import related taxes and the potential impact

of the sharp depreciation of the rupee in 2018.

The growth momentum in export earnings is

expected to accelerate in 2019, supported by the

enhancements of trade relations with new trading

partners, conducive external trade policies, strong

institutional support and a more competitive

exchange rate. The surplus in the services account

is expected to improve in 2019 supported by higher

inflows, particularly on account of tourism, IT, BPO

and transport services. The workers’ remittances

are expected to remain at current levels while the

deficit in the primary income account is expected to

widen with an increase in interest payments amidst

relatively tighter global financial market conditions.

Meanwhile, the financial account of the BOP is

expected to improve with higher FDI inflows into

the long-term development projects in the Colombo

Port City and the Hambantota industrial zone,

among others. Further, the foreign investments

to the CSE and the government securities market

are also expected to stabilize with the sluggish

pace of interest rate normalization in advanced

economies.In addition, the recommencement of the

IMF - EFF is also expected to strengthen the

external sector with improved investor sentiment.

The expected reduction in the current account deficit

and the accompanying financial account flows are

expected to contribute to the gradual strengthening

of the exchange rate and an accumulation of official

reserves during the year.

The external sector outlook in 2019 could

experience downside risks due to potential

vulnerabilities. On the domestic front, the net

impact of removal of import curtailing measures

introduced in the second half of 2018 and the tariff

adjustments introduced in imports subsequent to

the 2019 Budget along with the potential removal of

the suspension of using permits for vehicle imports

during the year could result in an increase in the

demand for vehicle imports, potentially reversing

some of the gains observed in the trade balance.

On the external front, the import expenditure on

fuel could also rise in the case of an increase

of global fuel prices due to a potential supply

restriction by oil producing countries and other

geopolitical factors. In addition, some pressure on

the exchange rate could materialize in 2019 with

political developments during elections towards

the second half of 2019. Further, the perceived

uncertainty in the pace and magnitude of interest

rate normalisation of advanced economies could

affect cross-border capital flows, thereby weighing

on envisaged foreign investments in the CSE and

government securities market.

The projected rise in foreign currency debt

service payments remains a major concern in

2019 and over the medium term. With annual

external debt repayment commitments of over

US dollars 5 billion on average, mainly including

the maturity of several ISBs and capital repayments

of foreign currency term financing facilities falling

due in 2019 and beyond, Sri Lanka could face

heightened refinancing risks, unless managed

by prudent debt management measures. In

this context, reducing the reliance on foreign

borrowings in financing the current account deficit,

maintaining a sustainable current account deficit

and bolstering international reserves through

long term non-debt creating capital flows would

be major priorities. The government’s plans to

attract FDI into the export oriented manufacturing

and services sectors need to ensure FDI inflows

of at least US dollars 3 billion per annum over the

medium-term in order to keep foreign borrowings at

a minimum level, thereby containing the vulnerability

of external debt. Further, the timely implementation

of measures towards harnessing the potential of

services exports, particularly as envisaged in the

National Export Strategy of the government could

ensure higher inflows of foreign exchange in 2019

and over the medium term.
