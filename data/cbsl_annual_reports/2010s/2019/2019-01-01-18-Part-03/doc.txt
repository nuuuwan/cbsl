Banking Act Directions No. 11 of 2018 30 November 2018

FOREIGN CURRENCY BORROWINGS BY LICENSED BANKS

Foreign currency borrowings are an important source of funding for banks. However, excessive and unregulated foreign capital flows are likely to cause unwarranted macroeconomic and financial stability concerns in a country.

The Monetary Board introduces a policy framework for foreign currency borrowings of licensed banks with the objectives of addressing the high dependence on foreign currency borrowings and the resulting exposure of licensed banks to foreign exchange risk and minimising the pressure on the reserves and exchange rate of the country arising from large borrowings in foreign currency.

Accordingly, the Monetary Board issues Directions to licensed commercial banks (LCBs) and licensed specialised banks (LSBs) as follows:

1.Empowerment under the Banking Act1.1 In terms of Sections 46(1) and 76J(1) of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988, in order to ensure the soundness of the banking system, the Monetary Board is empowered to issue Directions to all or any LCB and LSB, respectively, regarding the manner in which any aspect of the business of such bank or banks is to be conducted.

2.Applicability 2.1 These Directions shall be applicable to all foreign currency borrowings made from local and foreign sources by LCBs and LSBs, hereinafter referred to as licensed banks, covering Domestic Banking Units and Off-Shore Banking Units.3.Tenure3.1 Foreign currency borrowings with a remaining maturity of:

(i) 1 year or less will be considered as short-term borrowings; and (ii) more than 1 year will be considered as long-term borrowings.

4.Limits on Foreign Currency Borrowings4.1 The maximum outstanding amount of foreign currency borrowings obtained by a licensed bank shall be determined as a percentage of total assets as per the latest annual audited accounts or interim accounts certified by the External Auditor of the licensed bank.

Banking Act Directions No. 12 of 2018 28 December 2018

LEVERAGE RATIO UNDER BASEL IIIFOR LICENSED COMMERCIAL BANKS AND LICENSED SPECIALISED BANKS

In terms of the powers conferred by Sections 46(1) and 76(J)(1) of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988, as amended, the Monetary Board issues these Directions for the implementation of Leverage Ratio under Basel III for licensed commercial banks and licensed specialised banks (hereinafter referred to as licensed banks) in accordance with “Basel III: Finalising post-crisis reforms” issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2017. The aim of these Directions is to introduce a framework with a simple, transparent, non-risk based Leverage Ratio to act as a credible supplementary measure to the risk based capital requirement in order to restrict the build-up of leverage in the banking sector, helping to avoid any destabilising deleveraging processes which can damage the broader financial system and the economy, and reinforce the risk-based requirements with a simple, non-risk based “backstop” measure.

1.Empowerment1.1In terms of Sections 46(1) and 76J(1) of the Banking Act, in order to ensure the soundness of the banking system, the Monetary Board is empowered to issue Directions to all or any licensed bank, regarding the manner in which any aspect of the business of such bank or banks is to be conducted.

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

2.Scope of Application2.1These Directions shall be applicable to every licensed bank:(a) incorporated in Sri Lanka on a solo and consolidated basis; and(b) branches of banks incorporated or established outside Sri Lanka on a standalone basis.

3.Leverage Ratio Computation3.1Commencing 1 January 2019, the minimum Leverage Ratio for licensed banks shall be 3 per cent.

3.2Leverage Ratio shall be computed as prescribed below:

Leverage Ratio =Capital Measure

Exposure Measure

3.3The Leverage Ratio to be calculated on a quarterly basis.

4.Capital Measure4.1Licensed banks shall use Tier 1 capital (after deductions) as specified in the Banking Act Directions No. 01 of 2016 on Capital Requirements under Basel III as Capital measure for Leverage Ratio computation.

5.Exposure Measure5.1The exposure measure is computed as follows:Exposure Measure = On balance sheet exposures (excluding on-balance sheet derivative and Securities Financing Transaction exposures) + Derivative exposures + Securities Financing Transactions exposures + Off balance Sheet exposures

5.2Licensed banks shall not take account of physical or financial collateral, guarantees or other credit risk mitigation techniques in calculating the exposure measure.

5.3To ensure consistency, any item deducted from Tier 1 capital according to the Basel III framework and regulatory adjustments other than those related to liabilities shall be deducted from the exposure measure.

5.4Guidance on calculation of exposure measure is in Schedule I hereto.

6.Steps to Secure Compliance6.1Where a licensed bank has failed to comply with the minimum Leverage Ratio, such bank shall not pay dividends or repatriate profits or adopt any other measure that will further deteriorate the regulatory capital position of the licensed bank until such compliance is effected and confirmed by the Director of Bank Supervision.

7.DisclosureRequirements7.1The disclosure requirements prescribed in the Banking Act Directions No. 01 of 2016 on Capital Requirements under Basel III shall be applicable in respect of Leverage Ratio.

8.Regulatory Reporting8.1Every licensed bank shall report the Leverage Ratio as at the last calendar day of each quarter through the web-based off-site surveillance system via the quarterly return (BSD-QF-36-LR and BSD-QF-36-EM) within one month after the end of each quarter.

Guidelines to Licensed Banks on the Adoption of Sri Lanka Accounting Standard -

SLFRS 9: Financial Instruments

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka with a view to establishing consistent and prudent practices on the adoption of Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - SLFRS 9: Financial Instruments by licensed banks in Sri Lanka, encloses the Guidelines to licensed banks on the above for immediate implementation.

A A M ThassimDirector of Bank Supervision

Guidelines to Licensed Banks on the Adoption of Sri Lanka Accounting Standard – SLFRS 9:

Financial Instruments

1. Introduction

1.1 The new Sri Lanka Accounting Standard, ‘SLFRS 9: Financial Instruments’ shall be applicable for financial reporting periods beginning on or after 01.01.2018 and the adoption of SLFRS 9 has a significant impact towards banks and other financial institutions. 1.2 While the responsibility of preparation, presentation and disclosure of financial statements in line with the applicable Sri Lanka Accounting Standards is vested with the Board of Directors (BoD) and the senior management of licensed banks, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) promotes consistent and prudent application of SLFRS 9 in the banking sector.

1.3 In this respect, discussions were held with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, the Panel of Auditors and the banking sector to understand the concerns of licensed banks in the adoption of SLFRS 9.

1.4 These guidelines are prepared based on the ‘Guidance on Credit Risk and Accounting for Expected Credit Losses’ issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2015, the best practices and guidelines issued by the monetary authorities/regulators on implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards 9: Financial Instruments and taking into consideration the comments received from CA Sri Lanka, Panel of Auditors and licensed banks in this regard.

1.5 These Guidelines should be adopted within the requirements of SLFRS 9.

2. Objectives of Issuing Guidelines on Adoption of SLFRS 9

2.1 CBSL expects to establish consistent and prudent practices on adoption of SLFRS 9 by licensed banks in Sri Lanka.

2.2 Accordingly, licensed banks are required to adhere to the following Guidelines (in addition to the existing applicable regulations) as a minimum; on classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, management of credit risk, impairment of financial assets, valuation of collaterals, role of the internal audit, regulatory and reporting requirements; when preparing, presenting and publishing financial statements.

3. Classification and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

3.1 Classification and measurement of Financial Assets

(a) Business models approved by BoD (overseeing authority in respect of banks incorporated outside Sri Lanka) shall be in place to facilitate classification of financial assets. For this purpose, sufficient documentation on objectives, definitions, characteristics, criteria and operating policies along with adequate procedures and systems for assessing the business models on an on-going basis shall be in place.

(b) Such operating policies shall include, at a minimum, the decision-making authorities for business model decisions, level of sales to be considered as infrequent and insignificant, time period for near term selling to be considered for trading purposes, election of fair value option for instruments through profit or loss and through other comprehensive income.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Part III

Part III - 22

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

(c) In terms of SLFRS 9, debt instruments shall pass the SPPI test (contractual cash flows to meet Solely Payments of Principal and Interest) and if so such instruments shall be classified as ‘financial assets at amortised cost (AC)’ or ‘financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)’ based on the outcome of the business model test.

(d) Licensed banks are required to maintain standardised processes, detailed checklists and decision trees in order to assess and identify SPPI features of their products and contracts.

(e) Accordingly, broad classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets are given in Table 1 below.

(b) If a licensed bank is accounting for its financial liabilities as designated through profit or loss, changes in value of such liabilities due to changes in own credit risk are required to be assessed and accounted through other comprehensive income as stated above. Licensed banks are requested to formulate internal guidelines and criteria for this purpose.

1 In addition to these key characteristics other features of the product, management compensation, risk management aspects, frequency and significance of sales, etc. must also be considered.2 If that treatment creates or enlarges an accounting mismatch in profit or loss, an entity shall present all gains or losses on that liability (including the effects of changes in the credit risk of that liability) in profit or loss.

Part III - 23

3.3 Reclassification

(a) If the objective of the business model of the licensed bank for its financial assets changes and its previous model assessment would no longer apply, reclassification is required between financial assets under the provisions of SLFRS 9.

(b) In line with the requirements of SLFRS 9, such changes in business models and reclassifications shall be approved by the BoD and shall be notified to the Director of Bank Supervision within 7 working days of the date of such approval.

3.4 Measurement at Fair Value

When financial instruments are subsequently measured at fair value, licensed banks shall comply with the requirements given in ‘Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - SLFRS 13: Fair Value Measurement’ and are required to:

(a) Use an appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is available;

(b) Apply the selected valuation technique consistently;

(c) Maximise the use of relevant observable inputs. In exceptional circumstances, unobservable inputs may be used; and

(d) If inputs under level 3 hierarchy are used in the respective valuation technique, the Chief Risk Officer or most senior officer overseeing the risk management function shall confirm the appropriateness and reliability of such inputs.

4. Principles for Sound Credit Risk Management

4.1 BoD and the senior management are responsible for ensuring that the licensed banks have appropriate credit risk practices, including an effective system of internal control, to consistently determine adequate impairment allowances in accordance with the policies and procedures of licensed banks, the applicable Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and relevant supervisory guidance.

4.2 Licensed banks shall document and adhere to sound methodologies that address policies, procedures and controls for assessing and measuring credit risk on all financial assets. The measurement of impairment allowances should build upon those robust methodologies and result in the appropriate and timely recognition of expected credit losses in accordance with the applicable Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.

4.3 The aggregate amount of impairment allowances of licensed banks, regardless of whether allowance components are determined on a collective or an individual basis, should be adequate and consistent with the objectives of the applicable Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.

4.4 Licensed banks shall have policies and procedures in place to validate models used to assess and measure expected credit losses.

4.5 Licensed banks shall use experienced credit judgment, especially in the robust consideration of reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, including macro-economic factors, to measure the expected credit losses.

4.6 Licensed banks should have a sound credit risk assessment and measurement process with the support of adequate systems, tools and data to assess credit risk and to account for expected credit losses.

4.7 Licensed bank’s public disclosures should promote transparency and comparability by providing timely, relevant and useful information.

5. Impairment of Financial Assets

5.1 Calculation of Expected Credit Losses

Licensed banks are required to calculate expected credit losses for the following:

(a) Financial assets measured at AC

(b) Financial assets mandatorily measured at FVOCI

(c) Loan commitments when there is an obligation to extend credit (except those measured at Fair Value through Profit or Loss)

(d) Financial guarantee contracts (except those measured at Fair Value through Profit or Loss)

(e) Lease receivables within the scope of LKAS 17: Leases

(f) Contract assets within the scope of SLFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers

5.2 Life-time Expected Credit Losses and 12 Month Expected Credit Losses

(a) At each reporting date, licensed banks shall measure the loss allowance for financial instruments at an amount equal to life-time expected losses, if the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition (except for the purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets).

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Part III

Part III - 24

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

(b) For purchased or originated credit impaired financial assets, lifetime expected credit losses shall be measured.

(c) In principle, life time expected credit losses and credit impaired loans are provided on an individual basis. However, due to lack of borrower-specific information, licensed banks may perform the assessment on appropriate groups or portfolios on a collective basis.

(d) At the reporting date, if the credit risk of a financial instrument has not increased significantly since the initial recognition, licensed banks shall measure the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12 month expected credit loss.

5.3 Economic Factor Adjustment

(a) Licensed banks shall use the forecasts and projections published by CBSL, International Monetary Fund and/or World Bank in all instances where such projections are available when adjusting credit provisioning models to reflect the economic conditions and forecasts.(b) If the required information is not available through above sources, licensed banks shall use credible alternative sources and shall maintain documentary evidence. (c) BoD approved policies shall be available to specify the sources to be used and licensed banks shall not cherry pick sources in their favour. 5.4 Significant Increase in Credit Risk

For the purpose of calculating life-time expected losses, as a minimum, if one or more of the following factors/conditions are met, it shall be considered as a significant increase in credit risk:

(a) When contractual payments of a customer are more than 30 days past due3 (subject to the rebuttable presumption in the SLFRS 9);

(b) When the risk rating of a customer or an instrument has been downgraded to B+ by an external credit rating agency and/or when there is a two-notch downgrade in the banks internal rating system. In the event no external credit rating is available, licensed banks are required to map their internal credit risk ratings with the ratings issued by the External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAI). For this purpose, licensed banks are required to refer the mapping of external credit ratings given in Direction No. 1 of 2016 on Capital Requirements under Basel III for Licensed Commercial Banks and Licensed Specialised Banks;

(c) When reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions directly affect the performance of a customer/group of customers, portfolios or instruments;

(d) When there is a significant change in the geographical locations or natural catastrophes that directly impact the performance of a customer/group of customers or an instrument;

(e) When the value of collateral is significantly reduced and/or realisibility of collateral is doubtful. Limits shall be set and documented by licensed banks;

(f) When a customer is subject to litigation, that significantly affects the performance of the credit facility;

(g) Frequent changes in the senior management of an institutional customer;

(h) Delay in the commencement of business operations/projects by more than two years from the originally agreed date;

(i) Modification of terms resulting in concessions, including extensions, deferment of payments, waiver of covenants etc.;

(j) When the customer is deceased/insolvent;

(k) When the bank is unable to contact or find the customer;

(l) A fall of 50% or more in the turnover and/or profit before tax of the customer when compared to the previous year; and

(m) Erosion in net-worth by more than 25% when compared to the previous year.

5.5 Models for Calculation of Expected Credit Losses

(a) Licensed banks shall consider all available and relevant internal and external data when estimating expected credit losses, ensuring that the estimates are robust, unbiased and reflective of current exposures.

(b) Licensed banks shall develop robust models to determine expected credit losses under SLFRS 9. Such models shall be tailored to reflect the bank’s risk profile.

(c) Licensed banks shall ensure that the relevant officers are well trained and competent on understanding the models adopted by them for this purpose.

(d) When obtaining support from external vendors/consultants in respect of model development, rigorous governance and internal control processes shall be adhered.

3 Days past due shall be calculated from contractual due date of the payment.

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 25

(e) If different models are used for different portfolios and instruments, licensed banks are required to document the reasons why the selected model is appropriate and all credit models must be reviewed at least annually.

(f) An effective model validation process shall be established to ensure that the credit risk assessment and measurement methods are able to generate accurate, consistent and unbiased predictive estimates on an ongoing basis.

(g) Licensed banks are required to desist from making changes in the parameters, inputs and assumptions used for the purpose of profit smoothening. The rationale and justification for any changes in the expected loss models shall be documented and justified by the Chief Risk Officer and approved by the BoD.

(h) Assumptions concerning the impact of changes in general economic developments on borrower’s repayment capacity, shall be made with sufficient prudence.

(i) In cases where banks incorporated outside Sri Lanka use models developed by head office or regional offices, to ensure appropriateness of the credit models to the Sri Lankan context, the local implementation team should carry out appropriate validation procedures.

5.6 Further, in respect of impairment of financial instruments, licensed banks shall follow the guidance given in

Annex I.

5.7 These guidelines are expected to be reviewed in future, looking at the market developments, data quality, model development and capacity within the banking sector.

6. Collateral Valuation

6.1 Expected cash flows from collateral realization shall be based on latest observed reliable market valuations and shall appropriately reflect the inherent uncertainty associated with distressed property liquidation (including the time taken for such realisation).

6.2 Any increase in valuations shall be substantiated by solid evidence that such increases are sustainable.

7. Role of Internal Audit

7.1 The Internal Audit function shall independently evaluate the effectiveness of the credit risk assessment, measurement systems and processes of licensed banks and shall ensure the acceptability of credit judgments.

7.2 Internal Audit function shall validate and evaluate all credit risk assessment models, inputs and assumptions used along with data smoothening, if any.

7.3 Internal audit function shall provide assurance over the adequacy and effectiveness of back testing, in order to ensure that the key drivers have been captured and calibrated accurately.

8. Regulatory Requirements

8.1 In line with the international best practices, CBSL is of the view that the existing prudential regulations pertaining to assets classification, measurement and provisioning should be in force.

8.2 Accordingly, licensed banks shall submit all periodical information including web based statutory returns to CBSL in accordance with the existing Orders, Determinations, Directions, Guidelines, Circulars and Instructions issued.

8.3 Licensed banks shall maintain adequate data/records and systems separately to identify, reconcile and report requirements under the Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and under the existing regulatory framework.

8.4 Impact on expected credit loss provisioning is required to be captured when preparing capital planning and stress testing processes of licensed banks.

8.5 In order to avoid stress on capital and in line with the guidance given by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, licensed banks shall stagger audited additional credit loss provisions arising from SLFRS 09 when compared with credit loss provisions under LKAS 39 as at first day of adoption of SLFRS 9, net of any other adjustment on first day impact to retained earnings and net of tax effects, throughout a transitional period of four years as given below for the purpose of calculating the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) under Banking Act Directions No. 01 of 2016 on Capital Requirements under Basel III.

Circular No. 35/01/005/0006/36 12 April 2018

To: All Licensed Commercial Banks and Primary Dealers

Operating Instructions pertaining to the provision of the Intra-Day Liquidity Facility (ILF) Against Scripless Government Securities on LankaSettle

These Operating instructions (OI) shall come into effect on 12th April 2018 and may be amended or varied by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) from time to time with reasonable notice to the Participating Institutions (PIs). OI pertaining to the provision of the ILF by the CBSL against eligible collateral are outlined below.

As provided for in the LankaSettle System Rules, CBSL may, at its discretion, provide funds under the ILF to PIs of the LankaSettle System with a view to facilitating the smooth operation of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System.

1. Ordinarily, all Dealer Direct Participants on LankaSettle other than Designated Non-Dealer Bidders are eligible for using the ILF. For the purposes of these OI;

i. LankaSettle System Rules (hereinafter referred to as System Rules) are the rules issued by the CBSL for the operations of the LankaSettle System in terms of the Monetary Law Act, which may be amended from time to time.

ii. PIs are the participants as defined under the general provisions of the System Rules. In order to become eligible for using the ILF, a PI shall sign an ILF Agreement in a prescribed form with the CBSL as required in rule 7.1 of volume 2 of the System Rules; and

iii. Eligible securities shall have the same meaning as defined in section 7.2 of volume 2 of the System Rules.

2. No encumbered security or a security owned by a third party shall be used by a PI as collateral to avail the ILF. In the event a PI was found to have used such security, the payments applicable to such use as specified in section 11.3 of volume 3 of the System Rules will be imposed.

Part III

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 41

3. Funds under ILF are provided free of interest upon the PI transferring eligible securities to the CBSL in accordance with these OI on the condition that the said securities shall be repurchased by the PI by repaying the outstanding amount obtained under the ILF on or before the time specified for repayment of such amount in the daily operating schedule in the System Rules.

4. Substitution of securities provided as collateral for ILF shall not be permitted.

Procedure to drawdown funds under the ILF

5. The CBSL will provide funds under the ILF only to the extent of the value of the Eligible Securities available in the ILF account of the PI at a given time. The value of Eligible Securities calculated based on the Official Prices determined by the CBSL for such purpose will be credited to each PI’s Settlement Account in the RTGS.

6. Eligible Securities available in the ILF account of the PI at the end of the previous business day will be automatically transferred to the CBSL’s ILF account at the time of opening of the System for business.

7. PIs may carry out multiple ILF drawdowns and repayments at their discretion within a business day, as and when an Intra-day liquidity requirement arises, by initiating a request through the System. A PI who wishes to obtain funds under the ILF shall reposition a sufficient quantity of Eligible Securities in its ILF account in the LankaSecure in order to avail the ILF.

Official Prices of Securities

8. The Official Prices of Eligible Securities shall be determined by the CBSL on a daily basis, based on the latest available current market prices and market developments. A haircut is applied in arriving at the official prices depending on the type of the security and tenor. Such Official Prices are recorded in the LankaSecure System and in the Online Electronic Bidding System (OEBS) used for Open Market Operations (OMO).

Settlement of funds obtained under the ILF at the end of the business day

9. PIs may return the funds borrowed under the ILF fully or partially and regain whole or part of the securities used as collateral before the time specified for repayment of funds borrowed under the ILF in the daily operating schedule issued in terms of the System Rules.

10. All outstanding ILF balances should be settled by the PIs before the close of business as specified in the daily operating schedule issued in terms of the System Rules. For this purpose, PIs must ensure that sufficient funds are available in their Settlement Accounts in the RTGS at the time of reversal of ILF balances to enable CBSL to recover any outstanding ILF balances.

11. The process of recovery of outstanding ILF balances is initiated through the system at the time specified for the same in the daily operating schedule issued in terms of the LankaSettle system rules. A settlement request will be submitted to RTGS on DVP terms which will transfer securities from the CBSL’s ILF Account to the ILF Account of the PI, subject to availability of funds in the respective RTGS account. The reversal of ILF balances will be done at the original price and the original transaction value.

Default of funds borrowed under the ILF

12. If a PI fails, for any reason whatsoever, to settle in full to CBSL, the amount outstanding under the ILF at the time specified in clause 10 above, the PI shall be deemed to be in default for the full sum so outstanding and shall become liable to pay default interest as set out in clause 16 below. Such default interest shall be debited to the PI’s Settlement account with the CBSL on the next business day.

13. Where a PI is deemed to be in default as set out above, such PI should repay in full, the amount in default and the default interest before the close of business on the next business day.

14. The system will revalue the securities in the custody of the CBSL and generate the reversal payment amount on the next business day based on the official prices relevant for the next business day. If the revalued amount is higher than the total amount of default and default interest, CBSL will repay the excess amount to the credit of the PI’s settlement account in the RTGS. If the revalued amount is lower than the total amount of default and the default interest, CBSL will charge the difference by debiting the PI’s settlement account in the RTGS.

15. The PI should ensure the availability of sufficient funds in its Settlement Account in the RTGS for the repayment of the revalued amount in default and the default interest on or before the close of business on the next Business Day. In the event the PI fails to settle the amount set out above before the end of business on the next Business Day, CBSL shall retain the securities against which such funds were provided and deal with them as CBSL deems fit.

16. On the first occasion of default of ILF, a PI shall be charged default interest at a rate of 5 per cent per month or part thereof. On each succeeding occasion of default during a calendar year, such default interest rate shall be increased by

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Part III

Part III - 42

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

100 basis points, provided that where such default occurs more than once within a 30 day period from the preceding default, CBSL shall have the right to retain the securities against which ILF was granted and to deal with them as CBSL deems fit, in addition to the right to charge default interest as stipulated in this clause. In the event of repeated default, the CBSL may withdraw the availability of the ILF to the PI for a period of time determined by the CBSL.

17. Notwithstanding the other provisions of the ILF agreement or Operating Instructions and notwithstanding the fact that default has not occurred more than once within the preceding 30 day period, the CBSL may, at its sole discretion, taking into consideration the circumstances of a default, decide to retain the securities, and to deal with them as the CBSL deems fit.

18. As set out in clause 2 above, if a PI is found to have used third party securities for availing of ILF, such PI will be considered to have violated both the System Rules and these OI. Following payments specified in the said rules shall be imposed for such violations.

Amount borrowed against third party securities (Rs. million)Rates charged per day (%)

Up to 1,0002.0

Above 1,0002.5

19. Notwithstanding the other provisions of these OI, CBSL may at its sole discretion, taking into consideration the circumstances of a default or use of third party securities, withdraw the availability of the ILF to a PI permanently or for a period of time determined by the CBSL.

20. Operating instructions issued in terms of circulars captioned ‘Operating Instructions on provision of Intra-Day Liquidity Facility (ILF) Against Scripless Government Securities on LankaSettle’ bearing no. 35/01/005/0006/5 dated 27 January 2004, no. 35/01/005/0006/07 dated 3 May 2004 and no. 35/01/005/0006/29 dated 24 March 2011 are hereby rescinded.

21. In the event of any discrepancy between these operating instructions and the ILF agreement, the ILF agreement prevails.

Guideline No. 01/18

To: CEO’s of All Financial Institutions

Guidelines on Money Laundering & Terrorist Financing Risk Management for Financial Institutions, No. 01 of 2018

The above Guidelines will come into force with immediate effect and shall be read together with the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No.06 of 2006 and the Financial Institutions (Customer Due Diligence) Rules, No. 01 of 2016.

This guideline shall be treated as minimum instructions and indications to identify and assess the risk of Money Laundering & Terrorist Financing (ML & TF) in their businesses and take effective measures to mitigate the identified risk. It is important that all financial institutions will prepare their own risk assessment and mitigation report in line with this guideline.

Director/Financial Intelligence UnitCc: Compliance Officer

Guidelines on Money Laundering & Terrorist Financing Risk Management for Financial Institutions, No. 01 of 2018

Introduction

1. The Financial Intelligence Unit of Sri Lanka (FIU), acting within the powers vested with it under the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 06 of 2006 (FTRA), issued the Financial Institutions (Customer Due Diligence) Rules, No. 01 of 2016 by Gazette Extraordinary No. 1951/13, dated January 27, 2016; effective from the date of issue, applicable to institutions which engage in “finance business” as defined under Section 33 of the FTRA.

2. As applicable under Rule 3 of the Financial Institutions (Customer Due Diligence) Rules, No. 01 of 2016, the rules introduce, inter alia, provisions requiring financial institutions identified under the rules to take measures specified therein for the purpose of identifying, assessing, and managing Money Laundering (ML) and Terrorist Financing (TF) risks posed by its customers and business activities.

Risk Management

3. Every Financial Institution should identify and analyze ML/TF risks present within the financial institution and design and effective implementation of policies and procedures that are commensurate with and that mitigate the identified risks to ensure sound ML/TF risk management.

4. In conducting a comprehensive risk assessment to evaluate ML/TF risks, every financial institution should consider all the relevant risk factors present in its customer base, products, delivery channels and services offered (including products under development or to be launched) and the jurisdictions within which it or its customers do business.

5. Risk assessments should be based on specific operational and transactional data and other internal information collected by the financial institution as well as external sources of information such as national risk assessments conducted by Sri Lanka

Part III

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 55

and by governmental agencies of foreign jurisdictions where the financial institution has business relationships, either through customers or branch/subsidiary networks, country reports from reliable international and regional organizations, such as reports and reviews prepared by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), FATF-style regional bodies such as the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG), International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank publications, and information from reliable commercial intelligence providers.

6. Financial Institutions are required to have a risk management framework to address ML/TF risks. Such a framework includes policies, controls and procedures that enable them to identify, measure, monitor, control and mitigate effectively the ML/TF risks that have been identified.

Risk Management Framework

Corporate Governance

7. The FIU expects financial institutions to establish a robust and effective corporate governance framework that ensures transparency, accountability and high ethical conduct in all aspects of their operations. Institutions should adopt a Code of Ethics that promotes consistently high standards of ethical conduct by all employees. A sound corporate governance framework includes the use of effective policies and procedures, monitoring and reporting mechanisms and internal controls. Measures that ensure appropriate separation of functions and the avoidance of conflicts of interests are essential hallmarks of an effective corporate governance regime. The Board of Directors (BoD) is ultimately responsible for establishing a corporate vision, strategy and business model and for overseeing an institution’s corporate governance culture and is expected to develop mechanisms including board committees to achieve this objective. Senior management is responsible for ensuring the effective functioning of the corporate governance framework on a day-to day basis.

I. Board of Directors (BoD)

8. Members of the BoD should have a good understanding of the institution’s business model and operations and the general business climate in which it operates. They should have the qualifications and experience necessary to understand the institution’s business model and operations and how these relate to Sri Lanka’s general economic and social environment. The BoD should ideally be comprised of both executive and non-executive directors to ensure a desirable level of independence from the institution’s management function.

9. The BoD should establish the institution’s overall risk appetite and should ensure that mechanisms are in place to effectively mitigate risk. The BoD must ensure that appropriate policies, procedures and controls are in place to manage such risks and should also ensure that arrangements are in place for the effective reporting on all issues related to the functioning of the risk management framework. The BoD is ultimately responsible for the institution’s operations, its management of the risk to which it is exposed and its compliance with all laws, regulations and guidelines to which it is subject.

II. Senior Management

10. An institution’s senior management is responsible for implementing the corporate vision, strategy and business model approved by the BoD. Senior management should demonstrate a firm understanding of all aspects of the institution’s business model and is responsible for developing the components of the risk management framework. Senior management is responsible for ensuring that the institution has all the resources necessary to effectively manage risk. They are also responsible for ensuring that effective communication and reporting arrangements are in place to support good risk management practices. This includes ensuring that all staff members are aware of the requirements of the risk management framework and their specific roles and responsibilities. Senior management is responsible for ensuring that internal reporting mechanisms, including reports to be sent to the BoD, are developed to provide accurate and timely information relevant to the effective management of risks.

The Risk Management Function

11. The FIU expects institutions to develop an effective risk management function. The risk management function responsible for ensuring that the institution effectively identifies, measures, monitors, and controls and mitigates risks. From a day-to-day operational perspective risk management supports senior management and the BoD to achieve the ML/TF risk management objectives discussed in this guidance note. The risk management function should be commensurate with the, size, nature and complexity of the institution’s business model and operations.

Policies and Procedures

12. The FIU expects the senior management to develop policies and procedures to effectively manage the ML/TF risks that arise from an institution’s operations. Policies and procedures developed by senior management should be approved by the BoD. Policies and procedures should set out the day-to-day measures that should be employed to ensure that

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Part III

Part III - 56

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

the institution effectively identifies, measures, monitors and controls ML/TF risks. They should therefore be developed to reflect the risks implicit in an institution’s customers, products and services, delivery channels and geographic regions. Policies and procedures should be comprehensively documented and communicated to all staff. They should also be subject to periodic review to ensure they are appropriate in light of changes to the institution’s ML/TF risk profile.

13. Policies and procedures should clearly set out lines of responsibility and accountability for the execution of the risk management function and should also establish effective reporting lines for all persons and business units involved in the management of ML/TF risks.

14. An effective risk management framework should establish limits in the context of the institution’s stated appetite for ML/TF risk and the overall effective implementation of the risk management system. Policies and procedures should limit, for example, an institution’s exposure to the ML/TF risks arising from exposure to specific types of customers, products and services, delivery channels and geographic regions. An effective ML/TF risk management framework should include a mechanism to report incidents where established limits have been breached and the frequency of such events.

Internal Controls

15. An on-going system of internal controls is an essential component of a risk management framework. Institutions are expected to employ measures on an on-going basis to ensure adherence to establish policies and procedures as well as relevant laws, regulations and guidelines.

16. Arrangements should be in place to reinforce the “four eyes” principle and avoid conflicts of interest. Measures should be employed, for example, to ensure adequate separation between operational and control functions such as front office and back office activities.

17. Institutions are expected to develop effective internal audit arrangements. The internal audit function should be an independent function with a direct reporting line to the Board Audit Committee. The internal audit function should periodically assess the effectiveness of the institution’s ML/FT risk management framework and practices paying specific attention to the institution’s adherence to established policies procedures and limits and applicable laws, regulations and guidelines.

18. Institutions are also expected to ensure that their ML/TF risk management framework and practices are subject to external audit review.

The Compliance Function

19. The FIU expects institutions to develop an effective compliance function as a component of its ML/TF risk management framework. The compliance function should be commensurate with the, size, nature and complexity of the institution’s business model and operations. The compliance function is separate from the internal audit function as it is a component of an institutions day-to-day operational activity. The compliance function should on an-ongoing basis assess the extent to which the institution is complying with established policies, procedures and limits and obligations arising from applicable laws, regulations and guidelines. The effectiveness of the compliance function rests heavily on the effectiveness with which the Mangement Information System (MIS) generates accurate and timely reports related to the management of ML/TF risks. Compliance officer should possess sufficient seniority and knowledge and be up to date with recent laws and regulations

Risk Monitoring and Reporting

20. To effectively control and mitigate risk, institutions may need to develop MIS systems that provide reliable data on the quantity and nature of ML/TF risks and the effectiveness with which risks are being mitigated. The MIS system used by an institution should be commensurate with the size, nature and complexity of its business model and operations. Such systems should constantly measure ML/TF risks, changes to the nature of such risks and should also report on adherence to the policies and procedures designed to mitigate risks. The system should, for example, not only identify instances in which policies and procedures have been breached but should maintain a record of all such incidents. The system should provide timely reports to all business units and senior management to allow them to make judgments on the measures necessary to manage risks. Reports should also be prepared and submitted to senior management and the BoD indicating how well the institution is managing risk and highlighting instances of breaches of risk management policies, procedures and limits and obligations arising from applicable laws, regulations and guidelines.

Training

21. The FIU expects institutions to have effective arrangements in place to train their staff on all issues related to their AML/CFT regime. It is important that staff understand the institution’s inherent ML/TF risks and the nature of the measures that have been developed to mitigate these risks. Training must be provided for all staff upon joining the institution and should

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 57

be an-ongoing activity. Apart from general training provided to all staff, targeted training programs should be developed for specific categories of staff in light of the nature of their work in the context of ML/FT risks. AML/CFT awareness raising programs should be conducted for members of the BoD.

Assessing ML/TF Risk – Some Guidance

22. The following guidance sets out a methodology for the conduct of an assessment of ML/TF risks by a financial institution. It is not mandatory to follow this methodology, however, the FIU requires that each financial institution should undertake a comprehensive assessment of its ML/TF risks and develop appropriate risk management processes.

I. Identification of Vulnerabilities:

23. Financial Institutions are required to take appropriate steps to identify aspects of their business activities, including types of customers and transactions, which may be vulnerable to ML/TF and should in doing so, take into account the findings of the National Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment of Sri Lanka1. Financial institutions should consider the following areas when identifying risk factors of their business that make them susceptible to ML/TF.

i. The nature, size and complexity of the business

The size and complexity of a financial institution plays an important role in how attractive or vulnerable it is for ML/TF. For example, a large financial institution is less likely to know its customers personally and this could offer a greater degree of anonymity to customers than a smaller financial institution.

Similarly, a financial institution that conducts complex transactions across international jurisdictions could offer greater opportunities for ML/TF than a purely domestic business.

ii. The products and services the business offers

Some products and services are more attractive for ML/TF. When considering whether the products and services the business offers could be susceptible or attractive for ML/TF, the following is a list of indicators (not exhaustive) that identifies ML/TF risk arising from products and services that are commonly offered by financial institutions.

- private banking services such as prioritized or privileged banking- credit/ debit and other top-up cards- non- face-to-face business relationship or transaction- payment received from unknown or unrelated third parties- any new product & service developed- services to walk-in customers- mobile banking- single premium insurance policy

iii. The types of customers the financial institution deals with

Listed below are some indicators (not an exhaustive list) to identify ML/TF risk arising from customers.Categories of customers pose a higher risk of ML/TF can include:

- new customers that wish to carry out a large transaction(s)- non face-to-face customer on-boarding- customers involved in occasional or one-off transactions above the threshold (either specified in the FTRA, the Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Rules or the financial institution’s internal limits)- customers who use complex business structures that offer no apparent financial benefits- customer or a group of customers making numerous transactions to the same individual or group- customers who are Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)- customer who has a business which involves large amounts of cash- customer whose identification is difficult to check- customer who bring in large amounts of used notes and/or small denomination notes.- customers conducting their business relationship or transactions in unusual circumstances for example: significant and unexplained geographic distance between the financial institution and the location of the customer, frequent and unexplained movement of accounts to different institutions, frequent and unexplained movement of funds between institutions in various geographic locations- non- resident customers

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Part III

Part III - 58

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

- corporate customers whose ownership structure is unusual and excessively complex- customers whose origin of wealth and/or source of funds cannot be easily verified or where the audit trail appears to be broken and/or unnecessarily layered- customers that are non-profit organizations- customers who conduct business through or are introduced by “gatekeepers” such as accountants, lawyers, or other professionals- customers of a type that have been identified in National or Sector Risk Assessments as higher risk

iv. the countries that the financial institution deals withFinancial institutions should give consideration to the following factors as indicators of higher risk for ML/TF:

- any country subject to United Nations sanctions embargoes or similar measures- any country identified by credible sources such as the FATF as lacking adequate AML and CFT system- any country which is identified by credible sources as having significant level of corruption, tax evasion, and other criminal activity- any country identified by credible sources as supporting TF- any country that are identified by credible sources as tax havens

v. the business delivery methods or channels

The way the financial institution delivers its products and services affects its vulnerability to ML/TF.

The following are some indicators (not an exhaustive list) that may help to identify ML/TF risk involved with business delivery methods or channels

- non-face-to-face customers (via post, telephone, internet,) that pose challenges for verifying the identity of the account holder/customer.- indirect relationships with customers (via intermediaries, gatekeepers, pooled accounts)

II. Risk Assessment

24. Having identified the threats involved, financial institutions need to assess and measure ML/TF risk in terms of the likelihood (chance of the risk event occurring) and the impact (the amount of loss or damage if the risk event occurs). The risk associated with an event is a combination of the likelihood that the event will occur and the seriousness of the damage it may do.

Likelihood scale

25. A likelihood scale refers to the potential of an ML/TF risk occurring in the business for the particular risk being assessed. Three levels of likelihood of ML/TF risk are shown below, but financial institutions can have as many scales as are necessary for their circumstances.

i. Very likely - Almost certain;ii. Likely- High probability;iii. Unlikely- Low probability, but not impossible.

Impact scale

26. An impact refers to the seriousness of the damage that is likely to be caused if the ML or TF occurs. In assessing the possible impact or consequences, the assessment should be made from a range of viewpoints relevant to the business. Those set out below are not exhaustive. The impact of ML/TF occurring could, depending on the individual financial institution and its business circumstances, be rated or looked at from the point of view of:

i. how it may affect the business in terms of financial loss relating to market perceptions (for example loss of investor confidence) and reputation or through fines or other sanctions (such as loss or suspension of business licenses) imposed by a regulatorii. the risk that a particular transaction may be seen to contribute to the activities of a terrorist or terrorist organizations.iii. the risk that a particular transaction may result in funds being used for any unlawful activity as defined in Section 33 of the FTRAiv. how it may affect the reputation of the financial institution if it is found to have aided, investigated, prosecuted or otherwise implicated in an illegal act, which may lead to loss of important commercial relationships (such as correspondent accounts) or being shunned by the community of customers or shareholders/investors

27. Three levels of impact of an ML/TF risk to financial institutions are shown below as an example. However, the FIU encourages financial institutions to develop their own ML/TF risk processes and assessments for dealing with certain customers/undertaking transactions in the way that best suits their business model/activities.

Part III

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 59

i. Major- significant consequences, that inflict substantial damage, possibly resulting in the closure of the financial institution, cessation of business activities, regulatory sanctions being imposed or financial/reputational damage being experienced by the financial institution which will have a significant impact on business activities.ii. Moderate- moderate impact, involving substantial damage to the business and its reputation.iii. Minor- minor or negligible consequences or effects upon the financial institution.

28. Based on the likelihood and impact scale, it is suggested that financial institutions should assess an overall risk score. The risk rating may be used to aid decision making and help in deciding what action to take in view of the overall risk. A suggested risk rating derivation can be seen in the risk matrix (Annex 1). However, institutions are encouraged to adopt their own approach to assessing, identifying and quantifying ML/TF risk. Irrespective of the methodology adopted, the FIU requires institutions to develop a framework and implement practices to effectively identify, measure, monitor, control and mitigate ML/TF risks as required by the FTRA and CDD Rules.

i. Extreme - risk almost certain to happen and/or to have very serious consequences on the financial institution, including its financial standing and reputation. Response: Do not allow transaction to occur/or customer relationship to be established or reduce the risk to acceptable level through risk mitigation, such as enhanced due diligence.ii. High - risk likely to happen and/or to have serious consequences. Response: Do not allow transaction/establishment of customer relationship until risk reduced through risk mitigation, such as enhanced due diligence.iii. Medium - possible this could happen and/or have moderate consequences. Response: Mitigate risk; normal CDD and other requirements apply.iv. Low - unlikely to happen and/or have minor or negligible consequences. Response: Mitigate risk: simplified CDD and other requirements apply.

III. Risk Mitigation

29. Once the financial institution assesses the ML/TF risk of individual customer, product/service, delivery channel and risks related to geographic region, it should develop strategies policies and procedures to manage and mitigate the risk.

Examples of a risk reduction or mitigation are:

i. Setting transaction limits for high-risk products or delivery channelsii. Having a management approval process for higher risk customers, products, services, or deliver channelsiii. Risk rating customers and applying different requirements for high or low risk customers including applying different identification and verification methods and enhanced customer due diligence requirementsiv. Not accepting customers who wish to transact with a high-risk country or customers that are considered to be higher risk based on the institution’s board-approved customer acceptance policy.

Risk Management Strategies

30. Financial institutions shall adopt the following components, among others, as part of their risk management strategy:

i. Develop and implement ML/TF risk management objectives at the board and senior management level of the financial institution and monitoring progress of implementation of objectives.

ii. Implement clearly defined management responsibilities and accountabilities regarding ML/TF risk management.

iii. Provide adequate staff resources to undertake functions associated with ML/TF risk management.

iv. Introduce staff reporting lines from the ML/TF risk management system level to the board or senior management level, with direct access to the board members or senior managers responsible for overseeing the system.

v. Implement procedural controls relevant to particular services and products, customers, and delivery channels that have been identified as being vulnerable to ML/TF.

vi. Documenting all ML/TF risk management policies and ensuring that these are kept up to date and reviewed regularly reflecting both the scope and nature of the institution’s activities and the findings of risk assessments conducted by authorities. Such policies should also identify processes relating to non-compliance, including reporting of suspicious transactions to the FIU.

vii. Provide appropriate training programs for staff to develop expertise in the identification of ML/TF risks across the financial institution, including reporting of suspicious transactions.

viii. Develop an effective information management system which produce detailed and accurate financial, operational and compliance data relevant to ML/TF risk management.

Enhanced and Simplified Due Diligence Measures

31. There are circumstances where the risk of ML/TF is higher and enhanced CDD measures must be taken and, where the risks of ML/TF are lower, simplified CDD measures may be taken. These enhanced and simplified measures are outlined below:

Enhanced due diligence measures for high risk customers/transactions

32. Every financial institution should examine and document, as far as reasonably possible, the background and purpose of all complex, unusual large transactions, and all unusual patterns of transactions, which have no apparent economic or lawful purpose. Where the risks of ML/TF are higher, financial institutions should be required to conduct enhanced due diligence (EDD) measures for higher-risk business relationships which may include:

i. Obtaining and verifying additional information on the customer (e.g. occupation, volume of assets, information available through public databases, internet search, etc.)ii. Updating more regularly the identification data of customer and beneficial owneriii. Obtaining and verifying additional information on the intended nature of the business relationshipiv. Obtaining and verifying information on the source of funds or source of wealth of the customerv. Obtaining and verifying information on the reasons for intended or performed transactions vi. Obtaining and verifying the approval of senior management to commence or continue the business relationshipvii. Conducting enhanced monitoring of the business relationship, by increasing the number and timing of controls applied, and selecting patterns of transactions that need further examinationviii. Requiring the first payment to be carried out through an account in the customer’s name with a bank subject to similar CDD standards.

Simplified CDD measures for low risk customers/transactions

33. Where the risks of ML/TF are lower, the financial institutions are, subject to the regulations, allowed to conduct simplified CDD measures, which should take into account the nature of the lower risk. The simplified measures should be commensurate with the lower risk factors (e.g. the simplified measures could relate only to customer acceptance measures or to aspects of ongoing monitoring).

Examples of possible measures are:

i. Verifying the identity of the customer and the beneficial owner after the establishment of the business relationship (delayed verification)ii. Reducing the frequency of customer identification updatesiii. Reducing the degree of on-going monitoring and scrutinizing transactions, based on a reasonable monetary thresholdiv. Not collecting specific information or carrying out specific measures to understand the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship, but inferring the purpose and nature from the type of transactions or business relationship established

34. Simplified CDD measures are not acceptable whenever there is a suspicion of ML/TF, or where specific higher-risk scenarios apply.

Compliance

Compliance Officer

5. Each Institution is required to appoint a Compliance Officer. The appointed officer should be responsible for the implementation of the Institutions’ AML/CFT compliance requirements. The Compliance Officer should have the authority and the resources necessary to discharge his or her responsibilities effectively.

6. According to the management structure of the Institution, the Compliance Officer should report on regular basis to the board of directors or senior management or to the owner or chief executive officer of the Institution. The Compliance Officer should be from the senior management level and have direct access to higher management or the board of directors.

7. For consistency and ongoing attention to the AML/CFT requirements, the Compliance Officer may choose to delegate certain duties to other employees of the Institution. However, where such a delegation is made, the Compliance Officer remains responsible for the implementation of the AML/CFT compliance requirement.

AML/CFT Compliance Policies and Procedures

8. Each Institution must establish written policies and procedures to assess ML/TF risks. These policies and procedures must be implemented in an effective manner to prevent, detect and remedy instances of non-compliance. It is important that the policies and procedures are communicated, understood and adhered in a timely manner within the Institution. These policies and procedures should be communicated to those who work in the areas relating to customer interactions.

9. Each Institution’s AML/CFT compliance policies and procedures must include an assessment of risks related to ML/ TF. The assessment must be conducted in a manner that is appropriate to the nature of the Institution’s business. This ML/TF risk assessment must be conducted notwithstanding any existing policies and procedures on customer identification, record keeping and reporting requirements.

10. The extent and level of detail of each Institution’s AML/CFT compliance policies and procedures will depend on the specific needs and the complexity of the Institution, as well as the Institution’s assessed risk to ML/TF.

11. The Institution’s AML/CFT compliance policies and procedures must be approved by senior management and/or board of directors of the Institution. The AML/CFT compliance policies and procedures must include, at a minimum, ML/TF risk assessment and risk mitigation measures, customer identification and verification, record keeping, submission of mandatory reports to the FIU and ensuring independent audits of the Institutions’ compliance policies and procedures. For example:

(a) In the case of reporting obligations relating to any suspicion of TF, the compliance policies and procedures of the Institution should include the screening of customers against UNSCR and other lists which are available on the FIU website (http://fiusrilanka.gov.lk) and elsewhere.

(b) Institutions should apply an enhanced level of caution when dealing with transactions involving countries or territories that have not yet established adequate AML/CFT measures that consistent with international standards. Institutions may refer the FATF website (http://fatf-gafi.org ) and other sources for this information.

12. Board of directors and senior management are required to understand the statutory duties on AML/CFT compliance vested upon the board of directors, the staff and the Institution. Senior management and the board of directors are ultimately responsible for making decisions related to policies, procedures and processes that mitigate and manage the risks of ML/TF within the business.

13. The Institution should have a screening policy when hiring employees to ensure high standards.

Compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolutions

14. The Institution should cross-check whether any customer or beneficiary appears on any designated list issued in compliance with United Nations Act, No. 45 of 1968, with respect to any designated list on targeted financial sanctions related to terrorism, terrorist financing and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and its financing (UNSCRs 1267 , 1373, 1718, 1540) and any other subsequent Resolutions.

15. It is required to immediately freeze funds, financial assets or economic resources of individuals and entities who are designated by the United Nations Security Council based on such person’s/entity’s connections with terrorism, terrorist financing and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and its financing. The Institution should have measures in place to identify and immediately freeze funds, financial assets or economic resources, of such designated persons and entities.

16. Upon freezing or lifting of such freezing of funds, other financial assets and economic resources of designated individuals and entities, or upon the occurrence of an attempted transaction by or for designated individuals or entities, Institutions shall, not later than 24 hours from the time of finding out such customer, inform to the Competent Authority with a copy to the FIU.

Part III

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 63

17. The Institution should ensure that no funds, financial assets or economic resources are made available to or for the benefit of such designated persons or entities or their beneficiaries.

Risk-Based Approach

18. A risk-based approach is a process that allows the Institution to identify, assess the risks of ML/TF, to develop controls to mitigate the identified ML/TF risks and ongoing monitoring of those controls. Each Institution must use their own judgment, knowledge and expertise to develop an appropriate risk-based approach for their particular organization, structure and business activities.

19. In the context of ML/TF, the risk-based approach is a process that encompasses the following steps:

(A) Identify the ML/TF risk;(B) Assess the ML/TF risks;(C) Design and implement controls to manage and mitigate the ML/TF risks;(D) Monitor and improve the effective operations of the risk based controls.

(A) Identify the ML/TF Risk

20. The Institution must be aware of ML/ TF risks inherent to the business activities. As a first step of the risk-based approach, the Institution should identify the ML/TF related risks that may arise from customers, countries or geographical areas and products, services, transactions or delivery channels, as well as from proposed innovations thereof. A second step may be to identify all entry and exit points for funds used by customers. Such entry and exit points are potentially useful to a money launderer during the placement and integration stages of the money laundering process.

21. Each institution must identify the ML/TF risks that may be associated with the products and services that are offered by the Institution based on their utility for ML/TF. For example, any financial service offered by an Institution that converts the form of funds or ownership of funds is potentially useful to a money launderer during the layering phase of the money laundering process such as a person who exchanged Rupees 1,000,000 for chips, and passes the chips to another person has effectively transferred ownership. If that person then exchange the chips for a casino cheques the form has also been converted.

(B) Assess the ML/TF Risks

22. A risk assessment is an analysis of potential threats and vulnerabilities of ML/ TF to which the Institution is exposed. The complexity of the assessment depends on the nature, size and ML/TF risks faced by the Institution.

23. When conducting a risk assessment, the Institution must consider and document the following factors:

(a) types of customers and customer relationships;(b) types of products and services and the delivery channels through which they are offered; (c) the geographic origins and locations of the customers;(d) other factors related to the Institution’s business activities;(e) whether the customer’s name is appearing in any UNSCR designated list.

24. The risk assessment requires detailed knowledge of business operations and sound judgment exercised by the assessors so the risks for ML/TF can be determined according to each individual factor as well as combinations of factors. The risk assessment will continuously change over time as the various risk factors evolve.

(C) Design and Implement Controls to Manage and Mitigate the ML/TF Risks

25. Risk mitigation is about implementing controls to address risk factors that are the source of the risk (i.e. threats, vulnerabilities) in a timely manner which is tolerable to the Institution is achieved. Controls should be in the form of written policies and procedures.

26. The Institution may develop and implement the following different types of mitigation measures through the Institution’s compliance policies, procedures and internal controls:

(a) reducing or avoiding the risk; for example, if a casino identifies and assesses as unacceptably risky wire transfers from jurisdictions that are known to have ineffective AML/CFT controls or high levels of corruption, then the risk can be reduced by putting a cap on the size and frequency of such transfers for individual customers or the risk can be eliminated by refusing to accept such transfers.

(b) controlling the risk; for example, building on the wire transfer example, the casino can apply enhanced due diligence to verify the legitimate source of funds and/or require that any winnings or cash-outs be returned to the customer exclusively through a wire transfer to the account from which the original wire transfer was received (Appendix 1 contains sample EFT controls). The casino can also apply enhanced monitoring to the gambling activities of the customer to ensure the absence of money laundering indicators.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Part III

Part III - 64

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

(c) transferring the risk; for example, again, building on the wire transfer example, the risk of funding accounts in some jurisdictions is sometimes transferred to licensed junket operators, which provide funds transfer services to their customers and with whom the casino may develop a relationship, subject to proper controls.

(D) Monitor and Improve the Effective Operations of the Risk Based Controls

27. The effective management of risk is a continuous and dynamic process. The Institution should ensure that the process of managing the risks of ML/TF is subject to regular review and is updated as new or emerging risks are identified, whether caused by changes in the scale or nature of operations, new products, new services, new customer types, etc.

Development of Training and Awareness Programmes

28. The Institution is required to provide training on AML/CFT compliance to board of directors, senior management, employees, agents or any other individuals authorized to act on behalf of the Institution.

29. Such training should consist of raising awareness of the internal policies and procedures for preventing ML/TF. The training programme should provide a clear understanding of Institution’s AML/CFT compliance policies and procedures and the related individual’s responsibilities.

Part III

Customer Due Diligence

Identification and Verification of Customer and Beneficial Owners

30. Each Institution is required to conduct CDD on customers and beneficial owners, including occasional and one-off customers, when they engage in inward and outward financial transactions that aggregate in either direction to the equivalent of United States Dollars 3,000 or more, regardless of the actual currency of the transaction(s), in a single business day. For this purpose, a “business day” is defined as any continuous 24-hour period that an Institution uses for keeping its business books and records. Institutions may use only one definition of a “business day” and must consistently apply the definition across all customers and customer activity when aggregating transactions to determine CDD requirements. For this purpose, a “financial transaction” includes all inward transfers of funds from the customer to Institution and all outward transfers of funds from Institution to the customer. Such transfers may include, but are not limited to, the purchase or sale of gambling chips or any other gambling instrument, purchase of casino cheques, or cashing of customer cheques, purchase or redemption of lottery tickets, inbound and outbound wire transfers, purchase and redemption of “ticket-in/ticket-out” documents. For example, if a casino patron buys the equivalent of United States Dollars 1,000 in casino chips using Sri Lankan Rupees and subsequently redeems the equivalent of United States Dollars 4,000 in casino chips for Sri Lankan Rupees then that customer does not need to be identified prior to completing the purchase. However, it is required to identify the customer prior to completing the redemption in accordance with these guidelines described herein. Likewise, a customer purchasing the equivalent of United States Dollars 3,000 in casino chips the Institution is required to conduct CDD prior to completing the purchase.

31. Due to the difficulties inherent in aggregating the value of a customer’s transactions on a business day, an Institution may wish to identify all customers as a condition of extending services of the Institution (perhaps through the issuance of player/membership cards).

32. If the Institution cannot satisfactorily apply due diligence measures in relation to a customer and/or beneficial owner, the Institution shall not carry out a transaction for that customer. Further, the Institution may also consider submitting an STR to the FIU.

33. If the actions of a customer appear as designed to deliberately avoid CDD requirements, then the Institution should consider submitting an STR to the FIU. For example, a customer who purchases the equivalent of United States Dollars 2,000 in chips just prior to the expiration of a business day and then purchases the same amount just after commencement of a new business day, without making meaningful wagers in the interim period, may be structuring his transactions to avoid CDD requirements.

34. Customers and beneficial owners that are identified as high risk should be subject to enhanced due diligence measures such as additional scrutiny and verification of identification information and source of funds.

High Risk Customers/Transactions

35. There are customers / types of transactions / products which may pose higher ML/TF risk to the Institution. In such a situation, the Institution is required to take additional measures. As examples:

(a) any customer who has links with countries which do not or which insufficiently comply with the recommendations of the FATF (For High Risk and Non-Cooperative Jurisdictions please refer to FAFT website; (http://fatf-gafi.org);

Part III

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 65

(b) any customer linked with a country that has been identified by a national authority as a jurisdiction of concern for drug trafficking, human trafficking, money laundering, terrorism or illicit financing;

(c) any country that has been identified by a reputable organization as having high levels of public corruption;

(d) any customer who conducts complex or unusual transactions, (whether completed or not), unusual patterns of transactions for the customer profile, transactions that match patterns associated with unlawful activity, and transactions which have no apparent lawful purpose;

(e) domestic and foreign PEPs, to include their family members and close associates;

(f) any customer or transaction, product type that the Institution has identified as posing a higher risk to the business. For example, gambling games that allow customers to play opposite sides of a bet (e.g. odd vs even numbers in roulette), such that the net bet is very low risk and the pure intention may not be to gamble, are at higher risk of ML. In this case, an unusually low “hold percentage” of a game might be an indicator of activity that is intended to place funds with little or no risk;

(g) customers that have a sudden unexplained increase in their gambling activity or method of funding their gambling activity are higher risk.

Specific Customer Due Diligence Requirements

Appendix III

Examples of ML using casinos and gambling houses – Cases taken from Financial Action Task Force Report, October 2010

Case 1- Proceeds of drugs trafficking used to purchase chips and claim funds as winnings

Offence: Drug importationJurisdiction: AustraliaTechnique: Chip purchase and cash outMechanism: CasinoInstrument: Casino chips, chip to cash transfer, casino cheques

A cargo consignment addressed to a person contained approximately 3.4 kilograms of black opium resin, concealed within the contents. The person was arrested when attempting to collect the consignment. Further investigation revealed the person to be a regular customer of a casino, having conducted approximately 50 betting transactions, predominantly chip cash-outs totaling AUD 890000. Very little casino gaming play was recorded for the person and it was assumed that he used the proceeds from previous importations to purchase chips and claim the funds as winnings.

Case 2 – Proceeds from bank hold up laundered through book-makers

Offence: Money LaunderingTechnique: low risk bets, playing games with low return and high win, betting on favouritesMechanism: Bookmakers, multiple bank accountsInstruments: Cash, cheques

During police investigations into armed robberies, it came to light that another individual has been placing a vast number of bets at various book-makers within one city. He always followed a similar pattern whereby the stakes were high and the odds low. In other words, he bet on “favourites” who were likely to win, although this likelihood meant that the sum received by the bet maker if he did win was relatively small. Consequently, he made a 7% net loss over a long period of time. This would be quite a serious loss for a professional gambler. He never received his winnings personally, but had cheques made out to a total of 14 different bank accounts in the names of 10 third parties. It was discovered that several of the cheques were issued in the names of the armed robbers and their immediate families. The link between the money launderer and the original criminals was established. The former was convicted of money laundering and sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. He had laundered approximately USD 3.3 million through the system.

Case 3 – Overseas nationals purchase winning jackpots with illegal proceeds

Offence: Drug trafficking & money launderingTechnique: Buying winning lottery ticketsMechanism: Winning jackpots, cashIndicators: purchasing winning jackpots; depositing winning cheques followed by immediate withdrawal

AUSTRAC referred a matter relating to a group of overseas nationals buying winning jackpots at various clubs in Sydney from legitimate winners. The suspects deposited approximately AUD 1.7 million in winning cheques within a year, immediately withdrawing money in cash afterwards. The source of funds used to buy winning jackpots was suspected to be from illegal means. This matter was referred to partner agencies for further investigation.

Compliance Officer

5. Each Institution is required to appoint a Compliance Officer. The appointed officer should be responsible for the implementation of the Institution’s AML/CFT compliance requirements. The Compliance Officer should have the authority and the resources necessary to discharge his or her responsibilities effectively.

6. According to the management structure of the Institution, the Compliance Officer should report on a regular basis to the board of directors or senior management, or to the owner or chief executive officer of the Institution. The Compliance

Part III

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 69

Officer should be from the senior management level and have direct access to higher management or the board of directors.

7. For consistency and ongoing attention to the AML/CFT requirements, the Compliance Officer may choose to delegate certain duties to other employees of the Institution. For example, the Compliance Officer may delegate an employee in a branch to ensure that compliance procedures are properly implemented at that branch. However, where such a delegation is made, the Compliance Officer remains responsible for the implementation of the AML/CFT compliance requirement.

AML/CFT Compliance Policies and Procedures

8. Each Institution must establish written policies and procedures to assess ML/TF risks. These policies and procedures must be implemented in an effective manner to prevent, detect and remedy instances of non-compliance. It is important that the policies and procedures are communicated, understood and adhered in a timely manner within the Institution. These policies and procedures should be communicated to those who work in the areas relating to customer interactions.

9. Each Institution’s AML/CFT compliance policies and procedures must include an assessment of risks related to ML/TF. The assessment must be conducted in a manner that is appropriate to the nature of the Institution’s business. This ML/TF risk assessment must be conducted notwithstanding any existing policies and procedures on customer identification, record keeping and reporting requirements.

10. The extent and the level of details of each Institution’s AML/CFT compliance policies and procedures will depend on the specific needs and the complexity of the Institution, as well as the Institution’s assessed risk to ML/TF.

11. The Institution’s AML/CFT compliance policies and procedures must be approved by the senior management and/or board of directors (if any). The AML/CFT compliance policies and procedures must include, at a minimum, ML/TF risk assessment and risk mitigation measures, customer identification and verification, record keeping, submission of mandatory reports to the FIU and ensuring independent audits of the Institution’s compliance policies and procedures. For example:

a) In the case of reporting obligations relating to any suspicion of TF, the compliance policies and procedures of the Institution should include the screening of customers against UNSCR and other lists which are available on the FIU website (http://fiusrilanka.gov.lk ) and elsewhere.

b) Institutions should apply an enhanced level of caution when dealing with transactions involving countries or territories that have not yet established adequate AML/CFT measures that consistent with international standards. Institutions may refer the FATF website (http://fatf-gafi.org) and other sources for this information.

12. Board of directors and senior management are required to understand statutory duties on AML/CFT compliance vested upon the board of directors, the staff and the Institution. Senior management and the board of directors are ultimately responsible for making decisions related to policies, procedures and processes that mitigate and manage the risks of ML/TF within the business.

13. The Institution should have a screening policy when hiring employees to ensure high standards.

Compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolutions

14. The Institution should cross-check whether any customer or beneficiary appears on any designated list issued in compliance with the United Nations Act, No. 45 of 1968, with respect to any designated list on targeted financial sanctions related to terrorism, terrorist financing and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and its financing (UNSCRs 1267, 1373, 1718, 1540) and any other subsequent Resolutions.

15. It is required to immediately freeze funds, financial assets or economic resources of individuals and entities who are designated by the United Nations Security Council based on such person’s/entity’s connections with terrorism, terrorist financing and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and its financing. The Institution should have measures in place to identify and immediately freeze funds, financial assets or economic resources, of such designated persons and entities.

16. Upon freezing or lifting of such freezing of funds, other financial assets and economic resources of designated individuals and entities, or upon the occurrence of an attempted transaction by or for designated individuals or entities, Institutions shall, not later than 24 hours from the time of finding out such customer, inform to the Competent Authority with a copy to the FIU.

17. The Institution should ensure that no funds, financial assets or economic resources are made available to or for the benefit of such designated persons or entities or their beneficiaries.

Risk-Based Approach

18. A risk-based approach is a process that allows the Institution to identify, assess the risks of ML/TF, to develop controls to mitigate the identified ML/TF risks and ongoing monitoring of those controls. Each Institution must use their own judgment, knowledge and expertise to develop an appropriate risk-based approach for their particular organization, structure and business activities.

19. In the context of ML/TF, the risk-based approach is a process that encompasses the following steps:

A. Identify the ML/TF risk;B. Assess the ML/TF risks;C. Design and implement controls to manage and mitigate the ML/TF risks;D. Monitor and improve the effective operations of the risk based controls.

(A) Identify the ML/TF Risk

20. The Institution must be aware of ML/TF risks inherent to the business activities. As the first step of the risk-based approach, the Institution should identify the ML/TF related risks that may arise from customers, countries or geographical areas and products, services, transactions or delivery channels as well as from proposed innovations thereof. An example of a checklist for their own ML/TF risk identification and assessment is given in Appendix I. By looking at this example, Institutions can prepare a checklist for their own ML/TF risk identification and assessment. This may be not the exact check list for identification of ML/TF risks in every institution. Therefore, Institutions can prepare an own risk identification checklist according to the requirements and the nature of its business.

21. The Institution has to identify the ML/TF risks that may be associated with the products and services that are offered by Institutions due to its vulnerability to ML/TF risks.

(B) Assess the ML/TF Risks

22. A risk assessment is an analysis of potential threats and vulnerabilities of ML/TF to which the institution is exposed. The complexity of the assessment depends on the nature, size and ML/TF risks face by the Institution.

23. When conducting a risk assessment, the Institution has to consider and document the following factors;

a) Types of customers and business relationships the Institution having with them;

b) Types of products and services and the delivery channels through which they are offered;

c) The geographic origins and locations of the customers;

d) Other relevant factors related to the business activities;

e) Whether the Customer’s name is appearing in UNSCR designated list.

It is advised to follow the given example for ML and TF risk identification and assessment at the Appendix I. If your answer is “Yes” for any of those items in the example checklist, the Institutions should consider that fact as a high risk for ML/TF.

24. The risk assessment requires detailed knowledge of the business operations and sound judgment exercised by the assessors so the risks for ML/TF can be determined according to each individual factor as well as a combination of factors. The risk assessment will continuously change overtime as the various risk factors evolve.

25. Where the Institution’s dealings with a customer are limited to a single transaction (one-off transaction), it is not considered to be an ongoing business relationship. However, the Institution is required to complete a risk assessment of such customer. If the Institution suspects that the transaction is related to an ML/TF offence, then such transactions have to be reported to the FIU as an STR. Please refer part IV for further information.

(C) Design and Implement Controls to Manage and Mitigate the ML/TF Risks

26. Risk mitigation is about implementing controls to address risk factors that are the source of the risk (i.e. threats, vulnerabilities) in a timely manner which is tolerable to the Institution is achieved. Controls should be in the form of written policies and procedures.

27. The Institution may develop and implement the following different types of mitigation measures through the Institution’s compliance policies and procedures and internal controls.

a) Informing senior management about compliance initiatives, identified compliance deficiencies and corrective actions taken;

Part III

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 71

b) Ensuring the continuation of the AML/CFT compliance policies and procedures without any disruptions due to changes in management, employees or the structure of the business;

c) Focusing on complying with mandatory record keeping and reporting requirements including STRs, and adhering to regulations, rules and guidelines issued by the FIU;

d) Incorporating AML/CFT compliance into job descriptions;

e) Monitoring employees who handle cash transactions, attend to mandatory reports of AML/CFT measures, suspicious transactions or engage in any other activity that forms part of the AML/CFT policies and procedures;

f) Increasing awareness of high risk situations within the business;

g) Increasing the frequency of reviewing ongoing business relationships; and

(D) Monitor and Improve the Effective Operations of the Risk Based Controls

28. The effective management of ML/TF risk is a continuous and dynamic process. The Institution should ensure that the process of managing the risks of ML/TF is subject to regular review and is updated as new or emerging risks are identified, whether caused by changes in the scale or nature of operations, new products, new services, new customer types, etc.

Development of Training and Awareness Programmes

29. The Institution is required to provide training on AML/CFT compliance to board of directors, senior management, employees, agents or any other individuals authorized to act on behalf of the Institution.

30. Such training should consist of raising awareness of the internal policies and procedures for preventing ML/TF. The training programme should provide a clear understanding of Institution’s AML/CFT compliance policies and procedures and the related individual’s responsibilities.

Part III

Customer Due Diligence

Identification and Verification of Customer and Beneficial Owners

31. Each Institution is required to conduct CDD on customers and beneficial owners, including occasional and one-off customers, when they engage in transactions.

32. If the Institution cannot satisfactorily apply due diligence measures in relation to a customer and/or beneficial owner, the Institution shall not carry out a transaction for that customer. Further, the Institution may also consider submitting an STR to the FIU.

33. If the actions of a customer appear as designed to deliberately avoid CDD requirements, then the Institution should consider submitting an STR to the FIU.

34. Customers and beneficial owners that are identified as high risk should be subject to enhanced due diligence measures such as additional scrutiny and verification of identification information and source of funds.

CDD Measures for Dealers in Precious Metals and Dealers in Precious and Semi-Precious Stones

35. The Dealers in precious metals and dealers in precious and semi-precious stones are required to conduct CDD when the dealer engages in any cash transaction with a customer in Sri Lankan Rupee or in any foreign currency equivalent to or above United States Dollars 15,000.

36. These cash transactions include domestic gemstone/jewellery sale or purchase, gemstones/jewellery imports or exports and, gemstone/jewellery sale or purchase using auctions and exhibitions.

37. CDD in general will be conducted as a minimum requirement. However, when it comes to situations where a customer is identified as of high risk with respect to ML and TF, the Institution should apply enhanced due diligence measures.

CDD Measures for Agents in Real Estate Transactions

38. The real estate agents are required to conduct CDD when they engage in transactions with customers in buying and selling of a real estate property.

39. Real estate agents should be extra cautious about customer/s identity as well as ultimate beneficial owner/s when conducting CDD as there is a possibility of using a front person for buying properties.

40. CDD should be conducted at the time of making an initial deposit or paying an advance for the property.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Part III

Part III - 72

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

41. CDD should be conducted for all customers and beneficial owners who will be involved in the same property transaction. Ex. If there is a transfer of the sales agreement or selling that property to another customer or a buyer after making an advance/deposit or any other payment, CDD should be conducted for the new customer/s and beneficial owner/s who appear as new customer/buyer of the property and this should be continued until finalizing the property transaction by registration of the deed.

High Risk Customers/Transactions

42. There are customers / types of transactions / products which may pose higher ML/TF risk to the Institution. In such a situation, the Institution is required to take additional measures. As examples;

a) Any customer who has links with countries which do not or which insufficiently comply with the recommendations of the FATF (for High Risk and Non-Cooperative Jurisdictions please refer to FATF website (http://fatf-gafi.org);b) Any customer linked with a country that has been identified by a national authority as a jurisdiction of concern for drug trafficking, human trafficking, money laundering, terrorism or illicit financing;c) any country that has been identified by a reputable organization as having high levels of public corruption;(a) Any customer who conducts a complex or unusual transactions, (whether completed or not), unusual patterns of transactions for the customer profile, transactions that match patterns associated with unlawful activity, and transactions which have no apparent lawful purpose;d) Domestic and foreign PEPs to include their family members and close associates; e) Any customer, transaction or product type that the Institution has identified as posing a higher risk to the business.

Identification of Third Parties

43. The Institution must take reasonable measures to determine whether the Customer is acting on behalf of a third party, where the customer is an agent of the third party who is the beneficiary and/or who is providing the funds for the transaction. In cases where a third party is involved, the Institution must obtain information on the identity of the third party and their relationship with the customer, for CDD purposes.

Case Studies as Examples of ML & TF through Dealing in Precious Metals and Precious and Semi Stones:

Case study 1 - Trading gold to legitimize the proceeds of drug trafficking

The police of “country A” investigated that the illicit proceeds gained through drug trafficking has been used to purchase gold from “M Jewellers” by a drug dealer. These gold purchases were being done by a criminal organization and they have been buying gold from various gem and jewellery dealers using the illicit proceeds earned from the sale of drugs. Thereafter the acquired gold has been sold to many other jewellery shops.The proceeds of the sale of this gold have been transferred to a third party of “country D” that had links to drug trafficking. By transferring these funds the drug dealer laundered his illicit proceeds by completing the money laundering cycle of placement, layering and integration.

Case study 2 - Sale of Gems to another jurisdiction to fund terrorist activities

It was observed that the “company A” operating in country D has been frequently sending representatives to “country M” offering purchases of precious gemstones above the local market prices. As a result, fund transfers have been observed from country D to country M with very large volumes. The purpose of the transaction indicated was purchase of gemstones. The funds were then withdrawn in the “country M” either as cash or cheque withdrawals immediately after the fund transfers. Later it was revealed that persons who withdrawn funds from “country M” had links with a known terrorist group and the funds has been used to fund terrorist activities.

Appendix V

Case study 1: Real Estate Investments with Criminal Proceeds

Real estate transactions can be used by the money launders in every stage of the money laundering process.

Money laundering is a three-stage process of placement, layering and integration. The following case study is relevant to laundering money by placing proceeds of criminal activities in real estate activities. An individual called X formed two firms in different countries called Firm A and Firm B in country C and D. X’s intend was to conceal his involvement in these firms. Therefore, he used a person as front line and a trust to serve as legal representatives to hide his ownership. One of these firms was in real estate operations and the person appointed as the front line led the firm. By arranging a hedging facility (a back-to-back loan) to hedge against currency fluctuations in two countries he used illegally earned, drug proceeds to operate in these real estate investments. Also, he arranged a bank guarantee between two banks in case of a default of the loan. A banking guarantee was provided by a bank based on the pledged deposit of one of his companies as the collateral for the loan facility. The investigations revealed that the funds deposited for the guarantee was generated by X’s drug trafficking activities.

Indicators and methods identified in the case:

• Unwillingness to provide information of the borrower and collateral provider was the main doubt for this case. • The complex nature of loan arrangements and hedging instruments were involved to conceal layering of criminal proceeds.• Different complex arrangements to conceal the real ownership of the firms. • An unexpected loan default by the borrower built up the suspicious of real requirement of having a financial facility.

Case study 2: Misuse of a real estate agent to gain introduction to a financial institution, possible link to terrorist financing

A trustee for a trust established in abroad approached a real estate agent to buy a property in country X. The real-estate agent made inquiries with the bank M to ask whether a loan could be granted. The bank rejected the application, as the use of trusts and non-financial professional services appeared to be purposely done to disguise the identity of the beneficial owner or the real owner. Based on this suspicion, the bank M submitted a suspicious transaction report (STR) to the Financial Intelligence Unit. At the investigations it was found, one of the members of the board of the trust was found to be related to a bank with suspected links to a terrorist organization.

Indicators and methods identified in the scheme: • Real estate transactions using trusts.• Demanding for loan/mortgage facilities.• Trying to use institutional setups such as bank, trust, real-estate agent.

Guideline No. 04/18

To: CEO’s of All Financial Institutions

Guidelines on Identification of Beneficial Ownership for

Financial Institutions, No. 04 of 2018

The above Guidelines will come into force with immediate effect and shall be read together with the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 06 of 2006 and the Financial Institutions (Customer Due Diligence) Rules No. 01 of 2016.

Director/ Financial Intelligence Unit

Cc: Compliance Officers

Guidelines for Financial Institutions on Identification of

Beneficial Ownership, No. 04 of 2018

Introduction

1. This Guideline is issued pursuant to section 15(1)(j) of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 06 of 2006 (FTRA).

2. The Financial Intelligence Unit of Sri Lanka (FIU), acting within the powers vested with it under the FTRA, issued the Financial Institutions (Customer Due Diligence) Rules, No. 01 of 2016 (CDD Rules) by Gazette Extraordinary No. 1951/13, dated January 27, 2016, effective from the date of issue, applicable to institutions that engage in “finance business” as defined under Section 33 of the FTRA.

3. Rules 28-31, 48-50 of the CDD Rules established, inter alia, provisions requiring Financial Institutions (FIs) identified under the Rules to take appropriate measures to identify and verify the natural person(s) who are the ultimate “beneficial owners” of a customer that is a legal person or legal arrangement, as defined in Rule 99 of the CDD Rules.

4. This Guideline is provided as an aid to interpret and apply CDD Rules. The Guideline is not intended to be exhaustive and it does not impose legally binding practices on any FIs, and it does not constitute legal advice from the FIU. Nothing in this Guideline should be construed as releasing FIs from any of their obligations under the CDD Rules or the FTRA.

II. Background/Context

Who is a beneficial owner?

5. As per the Rule 99 of the CDD Rules, the “beneficial owner” of the legal person or legal arrangement is a natural person who ultimately owns or controls a customer or the person on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted including the person who exercises ultimate effective control over a legal person or a legal arrangement. According to Rule 49, controlling ownership interest means an interest acquired by providing more than ten percent (10%) of the capital of a legal person.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Part III

Part III - 78

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

6. It is an FI’s obligation to determine the natural person(s) who is/are the ultimate beneficial owner(s). The ultimate beneficial owner must be a natural person and cannot be a company, an organization or a legal arrangement. There may be more than one beneficial owner associated with a customer.

7. If the customer is a natural person, the person can be treated as the beneficial owner unless there are reasonable grounds to show that he is acting on behalf of another or if another person is the beneficial owner of the property of the customer.

Why is it important to identify the beneficial owner?

8. Corporate entities such as companies, trusts, foundations, partnerships, and other types of legal persons and arrangements conduct a wide variety of commercial and entrepreneurial activities. However, despite the essential and legitimate role that corporate entities play in the economy, under certain conditions, they have been misused for illicit purposes, including money laundering (ML), bribery and corruption, insider dealings, tax fraud, terrorist financing (TF), and other unlawful activities. This is because, for criminals trying to circumvent anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) measures, corporate entities provide an attractive avenue to disguise the ownership and hide the illicit origin.

9. Various studies conducted by Financial Action Task Force (FATF), World Bank, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) have explored the misuse of corporate entities for illicit purposes, including for ML/TF. In general, the lack of adequate, accurate and timely beneficial ownership information facilitates ML/TF by disguising:

a) the identity of known or suspected criminals, b) the true purpose of an account or property held by a corporate entities, and/or c) the source or use of funds or property associated with a corporate entities.

Ways in which beneficial ownership information can be hidden/obscured

10. Beneficial ownership information can be obscured through various ways, including but not limited to;

a) use of shell companies1 (which can be established with various forms of ownership structure), especially in cases where there is foreign ownership, which is spread across jurisdictions,b) complex ownership and control structures involving many layers of ownership, sometimes in the name of other legal persons and sometimes using a chain of ownership that is spread across several jurisdictions, c) bearer shares and bearer share warrants, d) use of legal persons as directors,e) formal nominee shareholders and directors where the identity of the nominator is undisclosed,f) informal nominee shareholders and directors, such as close associates and family,g) trust and other legal arrangements, which enable a separation of legal ownership and beneficial ownership of assets,h) use of intermediaries in forming legal persons, including professional intermediaries such as accountants, lawyers, notaries, trust and company service providers,

III. Establishing the Beneficial Owner

A) Beneficial owner of Legal Persons

11. As per Rule 99 of the CDD Rules, “legal person” means any entity other than a natural person that is able to establish a permanent customer relationship with a financial institution or otherwise owns property and includes a company, a body corporate, a foundation, a partnership or an association.

12. In the process of identifying beneficial owner(s) of a legal person, FIs have to consider three main elements:

a) Which natural person(s) owns or controls more than ten percent (10%) of the customer’s equity?b) Which natural person(s) has “effective control” of the legal person?c) On behalf of which natural person(s) the transaction is being conducted?

13. The beneficial owner(s) of a customer (legal person) may satisfy one or more of the three elements identified above. Accordingly, it would not be sufficient to simply apply only the ownership element in determining beneficial ownership.

Ownership

14. As per Rules 28 and 48, FIs are required to understand the ownership and control structure of their customers when the customer is not a natural person. According to Rule 49, the prescribed threshold for controlling interest is interpreted

1 Shell companies are companies that are incorporated with no significant operations or related assets, including an absence of physical presence

as owning more than ten percent (10%) of the customer. The ownership could be direct as well as indirect through aggregated ownership as illustrated below.

15. A natural person that exercises control over a controlling portion of equity interest, either directly, via nominees or via family members or close associates (whether disclosed or undisclosed) who nominally own or control the shares, can be considered as a beneficial owner. A majority shareholder or a majority formed by some combination of shareholders that are nominees for a natural person is also a beneficial owner.

16. For some customers, ownership may be spread over a large number of individuals with all individual owning less than ten percent (10%). In such instance, because no individual(s) owns more than ten percent (10%), the effective control element outlined below would be more appropriate to determine the beneficial owner(s)/controller(s).

Effective Control

17. Effective control of a legal person is an important component that determines the beneficial ownership. Such control can be direct or indirect, formal or informal. At a direct and formal level, it is essential to understand the customer’s governance structure as an aid in identifying those natural persons that exercise effective control over the customer. In deciding the effective controller(s) in relation to a customer, FIs should consider,

a) a natural person who can hire or terminate a member of senior level management;b) a natural person who can appoint or dismiss Directors; c) Senior managers who have control over daily/regular operations of the legal person/arrangement (e.g. a CEO, CFO or a Managing Director).

18. Natural persons may also control the legal person through other means such as:

a) Personal connections to persons in positions such as Executive Directors/ CEOs/ Managing Director or that possess ownership;b) Significant authority over a legal person’s financial relationships (including with financial institutions that hold accounts on behalf of a legal person) and the ongoing financial affairs of the legal person;c) Control without ownership by participating in the financing of the enterprise, or because of close family relationships, historical or contractual associations, or if a company defaults on certain payments;

Part III

Part III - 81

d) Use, enjoyment or benefiting from the assets owned by the legal person even if control is never exercised.

Mr. G is the managing director of the ABC Bank,which is the main financing source of the company A. In such a situation even if Mr. G holds less than ten percent (10%) of Company A, he has effective control over the company A through ABC Bank and should be considered as a beneficial owner through effective control.

Person on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted

19. Another aspect of the definition of beneficial ownership is a person on whose behalf a transaction is conducted. This may be the individual who is an underlying client of the customer. An example is, if a FI knows that person ‘A’ is conducting an occasional transaction on behalf of person ‘B’, and then person ‘A’ and person ‘B’ should be identified and verified along with any other beneficial owners that may be a party to transaction.

20. Acting on behalf of the customer is when a person is authorized to carry out transactions or other activities on behalf of the customer. However, ‘Authority to act’ should not be confused with effective control.

21. There are instances where persons are acting on behalf of a customer may not necessarily be the beneficial owners of that customer.

22. As per Rule 29, the FI has to identify the natural persons that act on behalf of the customer and verify the identity of such persons. The authority of such person to act on behalf of the customer also should be verified through documentary evidence including specimen signatures of the persons so authorized.

B) Beneficial owner of legal arrangements

23. As defined under Rule 99, legal arrangement includes an express trust, a fiduciary account or a nominee.

24. All trusts have the common characteristic of causing a separation between legal ownership and beneficial ownership. Legal ownership always rests with the trustee. Beneficial ownership can rest with the author of trust, trustees or beneficiaries, jointly or individually.

25. As per Rule 50, FIs should identify and take reasonable measures to verify information about a trust, including, the identities of the author of the trust, the trustees, the beneficiary or class of beneficiaries and any other natural person exercising ultimate effective control over the trust (including those who control through the chain of control or ownership).

26. FIs are required to obtain trust documents (e.g. deed of trust, instrument of trust, trust declaration, etc.) and the provisions of the trust document must be fully understood within the context of the laws of the governing jurisdiction. The FIs should take reasonable measures to verify trust document through independent means (e.g. Registry of Trust, Notary)

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Part III

Part III - 82

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Example:

Person ‘A’ is the author of a trust for the benefit of his child. The trustee seeks to establish a relationship with a financial institution to help manage the assets of the trust. Even though the trustee is the controller of the assets of the trust he may not be the ultimate beneficial owner and the main focus of CDD should include person ‘A’” as well.

IV. Identification and Verification of beneficial ownership information

27. As per Rule 30, FIs should obtain information to identify and take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the beneficial owner(s) of the customer using relevant information or data obtained from a reliable source, adequate for the FIs to satisfy itself that it knows who the beneficial owner(s) is.

28. Accordingly, the identification of beneficial owner is mandatory. Once the FI establishes who the beneficial owner(s) of a customer is/are, the FI must collect at least the following information in relation to each individual beneficial owner:a) full name; b) official personal identification or any other identification number;c) permanent/ residential address.

29. As per Rule 31, FI is required to verify the identity of the beneficial owner before or during the course of entering into a business relationship with, or conducting a transaction for an occasional customer.

30. Accordingly, once the identity is established, the FIs have to take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the beneficial owner(s). The reasonable measures for verification should be determined subject to the risk and complexities of the ownership and control structure of the legal person or arrangement.

31. Simplified verification procedures can be applied for verification of beneficial ownership of legal persons that are already subject to rules regarding corporate governance and transparency such as those that apply to firms with shares that publicly trade on a well-regulated exchange, or with simple and locally-familiar ownership structures or legal persons who are expected to conduct low risk transactions.

32. For the verification of beneficial ownership, some of the documentation that FIs can rely on may include (but not limited to) the following:a) Share register,b) Annual Returns,c) Trust deed,d) Partnership agreement,e) The constitution and/or certificate of incorporation for an incorporated association,f) The constitution of a registered co-operative society,g) Minutes of the board of directors meetings,h) Information available through open-source search or commercially available databases.

33. In case of foreign legal persons and arrangements FIs may also has to take additional measures such as verification through mother company or branches, correspondence bank, other agents of the bank, corporate registries etc.

34. As per Schedule I of the CDD Rules, in the case of companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Sri Lanka licensed under the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka Act, No. 36 of 1987 or any other stock exchange subject to disclosure requirements ensuring adequate transparency of the beneficial ownership, FIs can use relevant identification information available from reliable sources (e.g. a public register) to identify the Directors and major Shareholders.

35. As per Rule 49 (d), FIs have to identify the natural persons holding senior management positions as beneficial owners when FIs are unable to determine the beneficial owner as there is no person owning more than ten percent (10%) of the customer’s equity or no individual exercising control over the customer.

Periodic Review of Information

36. As per Rule 40, FIs should periodically review the adequacy of information obtained in respect of beneficial owners to ensure that the information is up to date. The review period and procedures thereof should be decided by each FI in its internal AML/CFT Policy according to the risk-based approach.

37. Any material/significant change in customer circumstances may necessitate a review of beneficial ownership. Some examples of material/significant changes include:

a. a public company is taken private;

Part III

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 83

b. a shareholder or group of shareholders takes effective control of voting shares;c. a new partner is added, or an existing partner is removed;d. change in management positions;e. new trustees are appointed;f. a trust is dissolved;g. a new account is opened for the same customer;h. transactions are attempted that are inconsistent with the customer’s profile.

Delayed Verification

38. As per Rules 31 and 32, FIs are allowed to delay the verification of identity of beneficial owners when,a. risk level of the customer is low and verification is not possible at the point of entering into the business relationship,b. there is no suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing risk involved,c. delay will not interrupt the normal conduct of business.

39. As per Rule 33, when delayed verification is allowed, FIs should adopt risk management procedures relating to the conditions under which the customer may utilize the business relationship prior to verification. These procedures should include a set of measures, such as a limitation of the number, types and/or amounts of transactions that can be performed and the monitoring of large or complex transactions being carried outside the expected types of transactions for that relationship.

40. As per Rule 36, FIs should not establish a business relationship or conduct any transaction with a customer who poses a high money laundering and terrorist financing risk, prior to verifying the identity of the beneficial owner.

41. As per Rule 35, when an FI is unable to comply with CDD measures as required in CDD Rule including identification and verification of beneficial ownership information, the FI should not enter into the business relationship or perform the transaction with new customers and terminate the business relationship with existing customers and consider making a suspicious transaction report in relation to the customer.

V. Other Requirements

Declaration of beneficial ownership by the customer

42. FIs may obtain beneficial ownership information either by obtaining the required information on a standard certification form (Certification Form (Appendix I) or by any other means, up to the satisfaction of the FIs with regard to the identification of the beneficial owner(s).

43. Use of the form is optional and FI may substitute this form with a version that is suitable, whether paper or electronic, so long as the required information is collected, protected, preserved and made available to competent authorities upon request and records are maintained in accordance with the CDD Rules and FTRA.

44. FIs are required to document the procedure to be followed in the identification and verification of beneficial ownership requirements relating to legal persons and arrangements in the AML/CFT Policy approved by the Board of Directors.

Record Keeping Obligations

45. The FIs are required to maintain records of identification and verification information relating to beneficial ownership as prescribed under Part V of the CDD Rules and FTRA.

Beneficial owners who are Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)

46. As per Rule 59, FIs are required to implement appropriate internal policies, procedures and controls to determine if the beneficial owner is a politically exposed person. Through such process if the FI identifies any beneficial owner as a PEP, the relationship should be considered as high risk and subject to enhanced due diligence as required in the CDD Rules.

Sanctions

47. Failure to comply with the beneficial ownership requirements as required under the CDD Rule will be a violation of the Section 2 (3) of the FTRA and will be punishable under Section 19 of FTRA.

VI. Examples

Example 1: Record for ownership and control structure of a legal person

ABC Company Ltd. is a private limited liability company registered under the Companies Act, No. 7 of 2007. Mr. A owns 25% of the shares and BC Company Ltd. owns the balance 75% of shares of ABC. Mr. S is Managing Director of ABC Company

Part III

Part III - 84

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

and; the Board of Directors consists with his wife, Mrs. S, ABC’s Chief Financial Officer; and their three children.In this example, FIs required to record:

• the ownership of the Company - shared by Mr. A (25% of the shares) and BC Company Ltd. (75% of the shares);• the ownership structure of the entity - ABC Company Ltd. is a privately traded.• the identification of all members the Board of Directors (Mr. S’s Family) as they are having effective control;• Identification of Mr. A as he is having more than 10% of ownership• identification of all of the individuals who own or control, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the shares of BC Company Ltd since it owns 75% of the shares, it also exercises control. However, in a case like this, FI must research further to determine whether any individual owns enough shares of BC Company Ltd. that would constitute 10% of ABC Company Ltd., or until FI determine that there is no such individual;• the manner in which FI obtained this information; and• the measures taken to verify accuracy of information.

Example 2 : Record for ownership and control structure of partnership

Rainbow Property Developers is a partnership engaged in buying and selling of real estate in Western Province owned by two partners (Mr. T and Mr. J). Mr. T and Mr. J have signed a partnership agreement stating that Mr. T will invest Rs. 5,000,000 in the partnership to rent space for the Rainbow Property Developers and other administrative expenses, and Mr. J will be solely responsible for operations of the business. All decisions related to the partnership must be unanimous; in case of a disagreement, either partner can decide to end the partnership. Mr. T & Mr. J will split the profits from the business 50/50. If they decide to end the partnership, Mr. T will get 55% of the proceeds of the sale of the business assets, while Mr. J will get 45%. In this example FI, is required to record:

• the ownership structure of the entity, including the details of the partnership between Mr. T & Mr. J;• identification of Mr. T and Mr. J as both control the partnership;• the manner in which, the FI obtained this information; and• the measures taken to confirm accuracy of information.

Note: The business structure is important in this example as the ownership and control of the partnership is shared between Mr. T & Mr. J. The FI needs to retain a copy of the partnership agreement to meet record keeping requirements as well as confirm the accuracy of the beneficial ownership information obtained. In the absence of such agreement it should be recorded that the partnership exists between Mr. T and Mr. J without having a written agreement.

To: CEO / General Managers of All Financial Institutions and Designated Non-Finance Businesses and Professions

Guidelines No. 5 of 2018 on Implementing United Nations (Sanctions in relation to

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) Regulations of 2017

The above Guideline will come into force with immediate effect and shall be read together with the United nations (Sanctions in relation to Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) Regulations of 2017, Financial Institutions (Customer Due Diligence) Rules No.01 of 2018 issued under Section 2(3) of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act No 06 of 2006.

Acting Director Financial Intelligence UnitCc: Compliance Officers

Guidelines, No. 5 of 2018 on Implementing United Nations (Sanctions in relation to Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) Regulations of 2017

Introduction

(1) The Minster of Foreign Affairs, acting within the powers vested with him under the United Nations Act, No 45 of 1968, issued the United Nations (Sanctions in relation to Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) Regulations of 2017 by Gazette Extraordinary No. 2039/32, dated October 06, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as DPRK Regulations), effective from the date of issue, applicable to Institutions which engage in “finance business” and “designated non-finance businesses” as defined under Section 33 of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006 (hereinafter referred to as Institutions).

(2) The present guidelines are issued by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to be adhered by Institutions, in accordance with the provisions of the DPRK Regulations, to facilitate their compliance with the provisions of the DPRK Regulations, and the effective implementation of the same in Sri Lanka.

(3) These guidelines will come into force with immediate effect and are required to be read together with the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 06 of 2006 and the DPRK Regulations.

(4) DPRK Regulations restrict any individual or entity located in Sri Lanka, or Sri Lankan individuals and entities located within or outside the jurisdiction of Sri Lanka, from carrying out financial transactions and providing financial services for a list of ‘designated individuals and entities’ (hereinafter referred to as designated persons), as well as for any individual or entity who may be involved in activities defined under the ‘Prohibited Activities’ of DPRK Regulations.

Setting up a Screening Mechanism for Designated Persons, Designated Items and Luxury Items

(5) Institutions are required to follow a two stage approach to comply with the DPRK Regulations.

(i) First stage is the screening of their customers against the consolidated list of designated persons, and any person (natural or legal) acting on behalf of designated persons.

(ii) Second stage is identifying transactions and financial services which are related to designated items, luxury items and prohibited activities.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 87

(6) As per DPRK Regulation 19 (3), the Competent Authority has published the first list of designated persons by Extraordinary Gazette No. 2067/14 dated April 19, 2018. It contains 70 individuals and 54 entities which are designated by the UN Security Council and the Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1718 (hereinafter referred to as the DPRK Committee). This list is frequently updated by the DPRK Committee, and the consolidated updated list is available in DPRK Committee’s web site https://www.un.org/sc/suborg/en/sanctions/1718/materials (as PDF, XML or HTML). As per DPRK Regulation 19 (4), the FIU will inform the Institutions by email, whenever there is an update to the consolidated designated list. The link to the updated list is also available in the ‘UN Sanction -> Sanctions on Proliferation’ section of the FIU web site.

(7) Institutions are required to maintain a complete, accurate and up to date customer details database in electronic form (computer based) to ensure effective screening process.

Screening of Customer Base against Designated Persons List

(8) Whenever there is a notification by the FIU on updates to the designated persons list, Institutions are required to obtain the updated list from the DPRK Committee’s web site, and perform a full screening of their customer base against the list. Institutions are advised to utilize a combination of name, date of birth, nationality, passport/NIC number and address for the search process. As there could be subtle differences between the list contents and customer data in Institutions’ database, a phonetic search is recommended for an effective search.

(9) Institutions are required to regularly obtain the updated designated persons list from the DPRK Committee’s web site, and use it for screening process. Whenever there is a new account opening for a new customer, the details of that customer are required to be screened against the designated list, and the Institutions are required to ensure that the customer is not a designated person. Similarly, whenever a transaction is carried out for any customer, Institutions are required to screen the sender and receiver of the transaction against the designated list, and ensure that no designated persons are involved.

(10) Institutions are required to develop processes to identify the beneficiaries of their accounts, and apply the same procedure described in these guidelines 8 and 9, to ensure that no designated persons are beneficiaries of the funds, accounts or other assets. Such processes are required to be developed so as to identify the beneficiaries wherever possible, and the Institutions are required to be able to demonstrate, if required, that the best efforts within the capacity of Institutions have been made to identify the beneficiaries of the funds, accounts or other assets.

Identification of Transactions and Financial Services related to Designated Items, Luxury Items and Prohibited Activities

(11) As per DPRK Regulation 4 (2), the Competent Authority has published the first list of designated items and luxury items by Extraordinary Gazette No. 2067/14 dated April 19, 2018. Similar to the designated persons list, FIU will inform the updates to the designated and luxury items list to Institutions by email. The link to the updated list is also available in the ‘UN Sanctions -> Sanctions on Proliferation’ section of the FIU web site. When doing trade transactions, Institutions are required to ensure that no designated item or luxury item is involved in a trade transaction where DPRK individual or entity (regardless of whether they are designated or not, including the government of DPRK) is a party or beneficiary. For that, Institutions are required to be vigilant of transactions where trade is from/to DPRK or its neighboring countries, and get more information regarding the trade.

(12) Institutions are required to pay special attention to DPRK Regulation 10 and obtain more details about the end users when providing financial services or transferring financial assets or other assets to any person or entity, to ensure that such services or transfers are not related to ballistic missile related or other Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD - chemical, biological, radioactive and nuclear) related activities, or prohibited activities defined in DPRK Regulations.

(13) As per DPRK Regulation 11, Institutions are required not to provide public and private financial support to a person engaged in any trade with DPRK individuals or entities (regardless of designated or not, including government of DPRK). Furthermore, Institutions are required to not establish any correspondence relationships with DPRK financial institutions.

Freezing of Funds, Accounts and Other Assets

(14) The Competent Authority has issued the freezing order by the Extraordinary Gazette No. 2071/03 dated May 14, 2018 to freeze the funds, accounts and other assets of designated persons. Accordingly, Institutions are required to screen their customers regularly and immediately freeze such funds, accounts and other assets maintained with the Institutions, upon identifying designated persons.

(15) In order to ascertain whether a customer is a designated person, Institutions are required to utilize the customer identification information obtained under Customer Due Diligence (CDD), as well as other publicly available information.

Part III - 88

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

(16) If Institutions cannot determine whether a customer is a designated person, due to the lack of information available in the designated list for that individual or entity, Institutions may contact FIU to obtain more details.

(17) After freezing the funds and other assets of designated persons, Institutions are required to immediately inform the Competent Authority and the FIU about the freezing actions including customer details and nature of the funds. After that, Institutions are required to make reasonable efforts to inform the customer immediately about the freezing of assets.

(18) Institutions can allow deposits to the frozen accounts, provided that such deposits are also frozen in the account. Competent Authority may issue an order to lift the freeze of an asset for specific situations, and the Institutions are required to immediately adhere to such order.

(19) If a customer whose assets are frozen, claims that he has been falsely identified as a designated person due to identical identity, Institutions are required to direct such customer to make a request to the Competent Authority and the FIU to lift the freeze.

(20) If Institutions identify a designated person in a transaction or financial service who is not a customer of Institutions (hence no assets to be frozen), Institutions are required to not carry out the transaction or financial service, and inform the Competent Authority about the particulars of such activity, and submit an STR to the FIU regarding the same.

Miscellaneous

(21) If Institutions has doubts whether a particular customer is a designated person, and require additional details from the customer to ascertain that, Institutions are required to get such information from the customer in a way that would not ‘tip off’ the customer. Such inquiry from the customer is required to be made after applying procedures to secure the funds, account or other asset to prevent the flight of assets.

(22) Institutions are required to make efforts to make their staff aware of above requirements, especially on how to identify trade transactions related to proliferation of WMD.

(23) Any person who contravenes the provisions in DPRK Regulations related to assets freezing and other prohibited activities shall be guilty of an offence and shall, on conviction by the High Court, be liable to imprisonment for a period of two to five years, and/or to a fine not exceeding rupees one million.

(24) Any person who contravenes the provisions in DPRK Regulations related to providing notices to the Competent Authority, FIU and customers of frozen assets, shall be guilty of an offence and shall, on conviction by the High Court, be liable to imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year, and/or to a fine not exceeding rupees five hundred thousand.

Guidelines for Financial Institutions on Suspicious

Transactions Reporting, No. 06 of 2018

The above mentioned Guidelines will come into force with immediate effect and shall be read together with the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 06 of 2006 and the Suspicious Transactions (Format) Regulations of 2017.

Director Financial Intelligence UnitCc: Compliance Officers

Guidelines for Financial Institutions on Suspicious Transactions Reporting,

No. 06 of 2018

Introduction

1. These Guidelines are issued pursuant to section 15(1)(j) of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006 (FTRA) applicable to Financial Institutions that engaged in or carrying out “finance business” as defined in Section 33 of the FTRA.

2. Suspicious Transactions (Format) Regulations of 2017 was issued on dated April 21, 2017 by Gazette Extraordinary No. 2015/56 applicable to Institutions which include institutions that engaged in or carrying out “finance business” as defined in Section 33 of the FTRA. These Guidelines are provided as an aid to interpret and apply Suspicious Transactions

Part III

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 89

(Format) Regulations of 2017. These Guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive and do not constitute legal advice from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). Nothing in these Guidelines should be construed as relieving Financial Institutions from any of their obligations under the Suspicious Transactions (Format) Regulations of 2017 or the FTRA.

3. The quality of a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) is important in increasing the effectiveness of the quality of analysis and investigations undertaken by FIU and law enforcement agencies relating to such STR which would assist in preventing abuse of the Sri Lankan financial system by criminals and terrorists. Quality, in this sense, means reports should be based on results from an AML/CFT programme that is effectively implemented and that the content in reports are complete, accurate and latest. This guideline aims at assisting Financial Institutions in improving the quality of STRs submitted.

Legal Obligation

4. Section 7 of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006 (FTRA) requires:

Where an Institution—

(a) has reasonable grounds to suspect that any transaction or attempted transaction may be related to the commission of any unlawful activity or any other criminal offence; or

(b) has information that it suspects may be relevant—

(i) to an act preparatory to an offence under the provisions of the Convention on the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism Act, No. 25 of 2005;

(ii) to an investigation or prosecution of a person or persons for an act constituting an unlawful activity, or may otherwise be of assistance in the enforcement of the Money Laundering Act, No. 5 of 2006 and the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, No. 25 of 2005,

the Institution shall, as soon as practicable, after forming that suspicion or receiving the information, but no later than two working days therefrom, report the transaction or attempted transaction or the information to the Financial Intelligence Unit.

Such reports are herein referred to as Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR).

5. As stated above as per the section 7 of the FTRA all “Institutions”, should report suspicious transactions to the FIU. Institution means, any person or body of persons engaged in or carrying out any finance business or designated non-finance business as defined in the Section 33 of the FTRA.

6. As per Section 14 (1) (b) (iv) of the FTRA every institution is required to establish and maintain procedures and systems to implement the reporting requirement under Section 7 of the FTRA. Further, Section 14 (1) (d) requires every Institution to train its officers, employees and agents to recognize suspicious transactions.

7. As per Rule 15 of the Financial Institutions Customer Due Diligence Rule, No 1 of 2016, the internal AML/CFT Policy approved by the Board of Directors should include policies, procedures on the detection and internal reporting procedure of unusual and suspicious transactions and the obligation to report suspicious transactions to the Financial Intelligence Unit.

Prerequisites for Development of Suspicion

8. Reporting of suspicious transactions is a major functionality in the operation of an effective institutional AML/CFT programme. For the AML/CFT function to be meaningful, they must result from a Financial Institution’s effective implementation of the FTRA, including all rules and instructions issued in relation to the FTRA. Financial Institutions without such effective implementation either tend to submit STRs that are inaccurate, incomplete or inappropriate or they may fail to report suspicious transactions entirely. Such failures expose the financial institution to regulatory, reputational, operational, and legal risks. In some cases, such failures may also expose both natural and legal persons to criminal liability.

9. For all but the very smallest institutions with the most intimate customer relationships, information about customers and transactions should be captured in a systematic manner and incorporated into their compliance and risk management processes. For larger Financial Institutions, this almost always means an electronic information system. Such systems typically operate based on rules, scenarios and profiles that seek to measure and assess deviance of observed patterns from expected patterns, or seek to measure and assess conformity of observed patterns to known patterns of abuse of the financial system. Such systems need to be carefully configured to reflect the specific assessed risks of the Financial Institution. Such systems need to be continually evaluated and adjusted to maximize effectiveness, need to be continually updated with new operational and third-party information and need to be fully integrated into the Financial Institution’s risk management process. When such systems generate alerts, it is important that the alerts are reviewed by the Financial Institution’s Compliance Officer. While such system-generated alerts may be the cause for an STR, such alerts are not by themselves likely to form a complete STR in accordance with these guidelines and are not an acceptable substitute for such an STR..

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Part III

Part III - 90

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Systems that operate in isolation are not effective. A system can only operate based on the information that is available to it. Systems are not generally capable of intuition or inference or human levels of perception. As such systems operate based on rules, scenarios and profiles that are designed by humans. For these reasons, Financial Institutions should not rely exclusively on systems to the exclusion of human involvement.

10. Whatever the source of customer and transaction knowledge, and whatever the technical sophistication of the AML/CFT system there must be an institutional will to make the system work. That is, there must be a will to detect suspicious transactions, to recognize in good faith such suspicious transactions for what they are when detected, and fully and accurately report such transactions, when recognized. Such institutional will is most effectively created by a commitment from those at the Senior Management including the Board of Directors of the Financial Institution and propagated through concrete actions and demonstrations (e.g. development of effective internal policies, processes and training programmes, compliance audits, investment in systems, consistent, fearless and disciplined exercise of judgment) to the rest of the staff of the Financial Institution.

Suspicion

11. Financial Institution must develop its own operating definition for suspicion. A Financial Institution’s operating definition of suspicion should incorporate elements of unresolved and unsubstantiated but persistent feelings of doubt about an objective set of facts and circumstances relating to a behaviour, to a single transaction, to a series of transactions, attempted transaction or to any combination thereof. It can be a feeling that something is not as it was expected to be, or as it was explained to be, given the totality of knowledge of the circumstances in which that something exits. The feeling of doubt cannot be relieved by proof, one way or another, since no proof is available. The definition should allow formation of a belief that is not firmly grounded or perfectly clear. At the same time, the definition should not allow these beliefs to be fanciful or fleeting. Certainly, the definition should count as suspicious behaviours and activities that are unusual for the circumstances and not adequately or believably explained.

The operating definition for suspicion must pass a test of reasonableness. If the definition is too narrow or rigid, it may exclude generation of reports that concern unknown or unanticipated unlawful circumstances (i.e. “false negatives”) and may also result in avoidance behaviour by criminals. On the other hand, a definition that is too broad or flexible might result in large number reports that are insufficiently analyzed and that do not reflect unlawful circumstances (i.e. “false positives” or “over compliance”). For Financial Institutions where electronic information systems are integrated into their processes, operating definitions are partially implemented by the triggers, profiles, scenarios and rules defined by the Financial Institution. Suspicious indicators and typologies may also be elements of such definition. The concept of “unusual” patterns of behaviour and transactions should also reflect in these definitions.

A non-exhaustive and unofficial list of suspicious indicators for transactions and behaviours is provided in Appendix I. The Financial Institution should complement this list with the Financial Institution’s own indicators. When using indicators, it should be remembered that these indicators are not formulae and they do not necessarily indicate the presence of criminality. Conversely, the lack of known indicators does not necessarily mean the absence of criminality, in part because criminals may adjust behaviour to avoid such indicators. Instead, indicators, and especially combinations of indicators, should cause increased scrutiny that may lead to the formation of suspicion.

12. Financial Institutions being over compliance or malicious compliance will not generate expected quality of the STR. Overcompliance and malicious compliance are strongly discouraged.

Over compliance results when Financial Institutions submit a large volume of reports that are inadequately analyzed or that fail to meet a reasonable standard of suspicion. Over compliance can be viewed as an attempt to transfer risk management from the Financial Institution to the FIU.

Malicious compliance is when an Financial Institution submits reports that, although they may contain some superficial elements of suspicion, are known by the Financial Institution to not actually of suspicious nature.

13. If after consideration of facts and circumstances available to the Financial Institution in good faith and within the context of the Financial Institution’s own understanding of suspicion and risks for the Financial Institution, and after gaining a thorough understanding of the FTRA and its implementing rules, regulations, circulars and guidelines, the Financial Institution has doubts about whether a behaviour or activity should be reported as suspicious, the best course of action is to report.

Reporting of STRs

14. When Financial Institutions are provided with access to the LankaFIN system: All reports must be submitted via LankaFIN online system or a successor system designated by the FIU followed by the signed hard copy of the STR submitted to the FIU by delivery or post.

Part III

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 91

15. When Financial Institutions are not provided with access to the LankaFIN system: Signed hard copy of the STR should be submitted to the FIU by delivery or post.

16. The Financial Institutions may submit STRs through other forms such as by way of email, fax or telephone in urgent situations to be followed by submission though LankaFIN and/or signed hard copy as appropriate within twenty-four hours.

Timing of Reporting

17. The FTRA requires suspicious reports to be submitted to the FIU as soon as practicably possible but no later than two working days of formation of suspicion. This means that, regardless of the Financial Institution’s processes, procedures and steps after the initial formation of suspicion, the suspicion itself must be reported even if the Financial Institution’s process has not completed. The Financial Institution’s process for dealing with suspicion may proceed concurrently with the reporting of suspicion.

For example, if the Financial Institution has a customer that receives a wire transfer in circumstances that the Financial Institution immediately considers to be suspicious, the Financial Institution must report the suspicious circumstances of that transaction as soon as practicable but within two working days even while the Financial Institution may continue with the internal processes that to verify the authenticity and details of the wire transfer.

18. If, after sending the report, the Financial Institution discovers additional facts and circumstances to either support or refute the Financial Institution’s initial suspicion, then the Financial Institution should inform the FIU appropriately.

Content of Reporting

19. Completeness: A single STR must stand alone and contain complete information about the suspicion. A STR should provide a full picture of the suspicion itself as well as the objective facts and circumstances that gave rise to and support that suspicion. Where multiple transactions and/or behaviours are connected with a suspicion, a single report should be filed capturing all of these.

20. Form Narrative: The narrative portion of the report is most important. This is particularly true with respect to LankaFIN since other form fields capture only a limited amount of information. This is the Financial Institution’s chance to fully describe the suspicion and the objective facts and circumstances that gave rise to and support the Financial Institution’s suspicion. In any case the Financial Institution is unable to provide the full detailed narrative through LankaFIN, the Financial Institution may provide the narrative in a separate document and submit to the FIU along with the signed hard copy of the STR. In such cases, the Financial Institution should mention a brief summary of the narrative in the LankaFIN system and explicitly mention that a full narrative will be sent with the hard copy. The narrative should attempt to answer to the extent possible the basic descriptive questions of what, who, when, where, why and how.

Financial Institutions should refrain from providing vague details of suspicions such as ‘several high value third party deposits from several branches around the country’. Instead, Financial Institutions should provide clear quantitative and qualitative data such as ‘10 number of third party deposits having values between LKR 75,000 – 90,000 from Jaffna, Trincomalee, Kandy, Matara, Galle, Kataragama and Badulla branches during September, 2017’ and provide relevant supporting documents (e.g. account statement for September 2017 including the details of third party depositors / deposits).

Some of the questions that the narrative should attempt to answer, if possible, include:

• What is the nature of the suspicion? • What offenses may have been committed? • What transactions, attempted transactions, behaviours, facts, belief and circumstances are involved and relevant to the suspicion? • Who are the natural and legal persons involved? • Who are the beneficial owners? • What are their identifiers such as names, ID numbers, registration numbers, etc.? • What are their addresses? • What are their occupations or lines/types of business? • Who are their employers? • What political exposure do they have, if any? • How are they connected with each other and with the transactions? • What were their roles in the transactions? • What property is involved? • What is the nature and disposition and estimated value of involved property? • When and where did the transactions or attempted transactions or behaviours occur?

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Part III

Part III - 92

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

• How, if at all, do the timing or location of the transactions contribute to the Financial Institution’s suspicion? • Why do these facts and circumstances support the suspicion? • How was the suspicion formed? • What triggers or indicators are present? • What actions have been taken by the reporting Financial Institution? • What related STRs have the Financial Institution already submitted? • What red flags are present? • What deviations from expected activities have taken place?

Financial Institutions are required to provide reasonable grounds for the suspicion and are requested to refrain from citing unjustifiable reasons such as ‘relationship between customers cannot be derived with the surnames’, ‘funds from African countries’, etc.

The narrative should be structured in a logical manner so that information can be conveyed to the FIU analyst as efficiently, completely and accurately as possible. Essay formats could be used for STR narratives i.e. having an introduction, a body, and a conclusion. Paragraph breaks can be used to divide the narrative into logical units and enhance readability. Within the body, information could be presented in a chronological manner when attempting to demonstrate possible causal links along a timeline. It is advised to minimize the use of Financial Institution’s internal jargon and acronyms brandings, product names by using generic descriptors instead. For example, use “six-month term deposit account” rather than “Mega-Six Platinum Elite Plus Super Saver Account.” Use punctuation and sentence case. Narrative should not be so brief as to compromise the goals of the narrative. It is advised to avoid words that do not contribute to the meaning of a sentence and to refrain from using too generic narratives such as ‘the transaction pattern does not match with the customer profile’.

21. Accuracy: It is imperative that factual information provided in the report is accurate. This is particularly true for identifiers such as names, ID numbers, registration numbers, etc. All spellings and transcriptions of identifiers should be double checked. A single inaccurate digit in a passport number or an NIC, or a misplaced or transposed character in a name, can make the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful analysis. Identifiers for legal entities (e.g. company / business registration number, registered name of company) should be exactly identical in every respect to those found on the official registration documents.

Submission of Supporting Documents

22. Financial Institutions are required to submit relevant supporting documents along with the STR. If the Financial Institution is unable to submit the supporting documents via LankaFIN, the Financial Institution should submit the relevant supporting documents through email and/or along with the signed hard copy of the STR. In such cases, Financial Institutions should mention in LankaFIN that additional supporting documents are submitted via email or through post.

23. Supporting documents should support rather than replace the STR contents, including the narrative. It is not acceptable to only refer to a supporting document in the narrative when information from the supporting document can be directly included in the narrative. For example, if the suspicion involves a letter of credit, all the details from the letter of credit that are related to the suspicion should be included in the narrative. A copy of letter itself can then be provided as a supporting document.

24. An indicative and non-exhaustive list of supporting documents along with corresponding scenarios are given below for reference.

Miscellaneous

Confidentiality

25. As per the Section 9 of the FTRA Financial Institutions are not allowed to inform any person, including the customer, about the contents of an STR and even that the Financial Institution has filed such a report to the FIU.

26. As per Rule 46 of the Financial Institutions Customer Due Diligence Rule, No. 1 of 2016, where a Financial Institution forms a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing risk relating to a customer and where the Financial Institution reasonably believes that conducting the process of CDD measures would tip off the customer, then the Financial Institution should terminate conducting the CDD measures and proceed with the transaction and immediately file an STR.

Breach of Confidentiality

27. If any customer is being tipped off about the reporting of STRs by any officer of the Financial Institution it would consider as a violation under the FTRA Section 9 and 10. This is described as the offence of ‘tipping off’ and is an offence punishable with a fine not exceeding five hundred thousand rupees or imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding two years, or to both such fine and imprisonment.

Protection for Persons Reporting STRs

28. As per Section 12 of the FTRA:

No civil, criminal or disciplinary proceedings shall lie against —

(a) a such Institution, an auditor or supervisory authority of an Institution ; or(b) a director, partner, an officer, employee or agent acting in the course of that person’s employment or agency of an Institution, firm of auditors or of a supervisory authority, in relation to any action by the Institution, the firm of auditors or the supervisory authority or a director, partner, officer, employee or agent of such Institution, firm or authority, carried out in terms of the FTRA in good faith or in compliance with regulations made under this Act or rules or directions given by the Financial Intelligence Unit in terms of the FTRA.

Failure to Report STRs

29. If a Financial Institution fails to submit STRs when reasonable grounds exist to suspect that a transaction is related to money laundering or terrorist financing, such is considered as non-compliance with the FTRA. As per Section 19 of the FTRA such non-compliances are liable to penalties up to one million rupees (Rs. 1,000,000.00) or double this for subsequent failures to report.

Should a reporting entity continue a business relationship with a customer about whom a STR has been reported?

30. The FTRA does not prohibit Financial Institutions from continuing business relationships with customers about whom STRs has been reported or suspicion has been formed. Especially Financial Institution’s behaviour toward the customer should not amount to any tipping off subject to the provisions of the Section 3 of the FTRA.

Obligations of Financial Institutions which has submitted an STR in relation to a customer and is continuing the business relationship

31. After the submission of an initial STR, the Financial Institution should continue to comply with all relevant provisions of the FTRA in all future dealings with that customer, which may include a requirement to submit additional STRs /information on further suspicions identified / further developments.

Further Information Requests

32. Where the FIU has requested further information regarding any STR, the Financial Institution should take all necessary measures to provide such information promptly to the FIU.

Appendix I

Suspicious Indicators

This appendix contains a list of indicators related to customer behaviours and activities. This list is necessarily non-exhaustive and incomplete and should be modified and supplemented as necessary by each Financial Institution. Indicators are not formulae and they do not always indicate the presence of criminality. Conversely, the lack of indicators does not mean the absence of criminality. However, the presence of an indicator, and especially the presence of multiple indicators, should cause increased scrutiny by the Financial Institution and such scrutiny may lead to the formation of suspicion.

Guidelines, No. 7 of 2018 on Implementing United Nations (Sanctions in relation to Iran) Regulations, No. 1 of 2018

Introduction

(1) The Minister of Foreign Affairs, acting within the powers vested with him under the United Nations Act, No. 45 of 1968, has issued United Nations (Sanctions in relation to Iran) Regulations, No. 1 of 2018 published by the Gazette Extraordinary

Part III

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 99

No. 2080/34 dated July 17, 2018 and its amendments published by the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2085/11 dated August 21, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as Iran Regulations) for the implementation of UNSCR 2231 (2015) in Sri Lanka.

(2) These guidelines are issued by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to be adhered by Institutions as defined under Section 33 of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006 (hereinafter referred to as Institutions), in accordance with the provisions of the Iran Regulations, to facilitate their compliance with the provisions of the Iran Regulations, and the effective implementation of the same in Sri Lanka.

(3) For Iran Regulations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs has appointed the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence as the Competent Authority, who is responsible for the overall implementation of the said Regulations in Sri Lanka.

(4) These guidelines will come into force with immediate effect and are required to be read together with the Iran Regulations, Financial Institutions (Customer Due Diligence) Rules, No. 1 of 2016 and Designated Non-Finance Business (Customer Due Diligence) Rules, No. 1 of 2018 issued under the Section 2(3) of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006.

(5) Iran Regulations restrict any individual or entity located in Sri Lanka, or Sri Lankan individuals and entities located outside the jurisdiction of Sri Lanka, from carrying out financial transactions and providing financial services for a list of ‘designated individuals and entities’ in Iran, as well as for any individuals or entities who may be acting on behalf or at the direction of designated individuals and entities (hereinafter referred to as designated persons and associates).

(6) The requirement to apply targeted financial sanctions in accordance with Iran Regulations is not risk-based, but rule-based, which means Institutions should carry out sanction screening regardless of the risk associated with a particular customer or a product.

(7) Sanction screening refers to the process of screening of the customer identities against the most recent list of designated persons by attempting to match key identification data, and screening of customers who may be owned or controlled by, or who may hold assets or conduct transactions on behalf of a designated person.

Targeted Financial Sanctions (TFS)

(8) Targeted Financial Sanctions (TFS) means both asset freezing and prohibitions to prevent funds or other assets from being made available, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of designated persons and entities, except as authorized by the Competent Authority under conditions described in the Regulations.

(9) Targeted financial sanctions relating to proliferation financing are applicable to persons and/or entities designated by the UN Security Council or the relevant committees set up by the Security Council. Designation/listing criteria are:

a. persons or entities engaging in or providing support for, including through illicit means, proliferation-sensitive activities and programmes;

b. acting on behalf of or at the direction of designated persons or entities;

c. owned or controlled by designated persons or entities; and

d. persons or entities assisting designated persons or entities in evading sanctions, or violating resolution provisions.

(10) Institutions are required to freeze immediately the funds, other financial assets and economic resources which are on their possession at the date of Iran Regulations or at any time thereafter that are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly by the persons/entities mentioned in guideline 5 above; and further ensure that no funds or other assets and economic resources are made available to such persons and entities, except in specific situations as authorized by the Competent Authority, and under conditions specified in the UNSC Resolutions.

Implementation Mechanism

(11) Institutions are required to follow a two-stage approach to comply with the Iran Regulations.

(i) First stage is the screening of new customers (at the time of customer onboarding) against the consolidated list of designated persons and associates, to make sure no such persons are becoming customers of the Institutions.

(ii) Second stage is the screening of the entire customer database as and when update notifications are issued by the FIU.

(12) As per Regulation 8 of the Iran Regulations, the freezing actions mentioned in the regulation 9 have immediate effect on Iranian individuals and entities who are designated by the United Nations Security Council. This means there will be no separate freezing orders or publishing of designated lists by the Competent Authority. Therefore, it is the responsibility of Institutions to make sure that no designated persons and associates are their customers, and the Institutions do not provide any financial services to such designated persons and associates.

Part III - 100

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

(13) Screening of names, addresses and other details against the consolidated list of designated persons and entities (including entities owned or controlled by them) published by the UN Security Council or its Committee is necessary in ensuring compliance with certain elements of targeted financial sanctions. However, the above screening would not be sufficient on its own, as targeted financial sanctions are also applicable to persons / entities acting on behalf of or at the direction of designated persons/entities. Therefore, the institutions are also required to identify the beneficial owners and other connected parties of their customers to the extent reasonably possible, and apply the screening measures to such associates as well.

Screening of New Customers at the time of Onboarding

(14) Whenever there is a new account opening for a new customer, the details of that customer are required to be screened against the designated list, and the Institutions are required to ensure that the customer is not a designated person or entity, before entering into a relationship with the customer.

(15) Institutions are required to identify the beneficiaries and/or beneficial owners of their accounts/transactions, and apply the same procedure described in these guidelines 8 to 10, to ensure that no designated persons and associates are beneficiaries and/or beneficial owners of the funds, accounts or other assets. Such processes are required to be developed so as to identify and verify beneficiaries and/or beneficial owners, and the Institutions are required to be able to demonstrate reasonable efforts have been made to verify the beneficiaries of the funds, accounts or other assets.

Screening of the Customer Database upon Update Notification by the FIU

(16) As soon as the FIU receives a notice from the UN regarding updates to the UNSCR 2231 list, the FIU will circulate a notification email among the Institutions who are registered with the FIU as reporting entities. Whenever there is such notification by the FIU, Institutions are required to obtain the updated list from the United Nations Security Council’s UNSCR 2231 (2015) website (http://www.un.org/en/sc/2231/list.shtml), and perform a full screening of their customer base against the list. Institutions are advised to utilize a combinations of search criteria that include name, date of birth, nationality, passport/NIC number and addresses of designated persons. The list is available in PDF, XML and HTML formats, therefore the Institutions can develop computer applications to process the contents in those lists, in order to be fed into their screening databases. As there could be subtle differences between the list contents and customer data in Institutions’ databases, a multiple search techniques including phonetic search are recommended for an effective search.

Other Measures

(17) Institutions should report to the Competent Authority and the FIU information on any assets frozen or actions taken in compliance with the prohibition requirements of the relevant Regulations, including attempted transactions, after freezing of such assets.

(18) When the Competent Authority issues an authorization to use the frozen funds for exemption conditions, Institutions should have mechanisms to release such frozen funds without delay. Where the funds or other assets are owned or held by a designated non- financial institution, institutions should undertake a number of additional measures and safeguards to ensure that only permitted payments are made.

(19) For transactions involving non-account holders / walk-in customers and third-party customers (such as cheque encashment, pay orders and currency exchanges), Institutions should perform screening before conducting the transaction. For that, adequate mechanisms should be set up to obtain information from such customers. If the Institution identifies a possible match due to such screening, then it should collect funds from the payer and then freeze the transaction/funds.
