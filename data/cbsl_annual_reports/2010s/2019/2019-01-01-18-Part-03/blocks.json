As a first step of the risk-based approach, the Institution should identify the ML/TF related risks that may arise from customers, countries or geographical areas and products, services, transactions or delivery channels, as well as from proposed innovations thereof. A second step may be to identify all entry and exit points for funds used by customers. Such entry and exit points are potentially useful to a money launderer during the placement and integration stages of the money laundering process.",

Institutions may use only one definition of a \u201cbusiness day\u201d and must consistently apply the definition across all customers and customer activity when aggregating transactions to determine CDD requirements. For this purpose, a \u201cfinancial transaction\u201d includes all inward transfers of funds from the customer to Institution and all outward transfers of funds from Institution to the customer. Such transfers may include, but are not limited to, the purchase or sale of gambling chips or any other gambling instrument, purchase of casino cheques, or cashing of customer cheques, purchase or redemption of lottery tickets, inbound and outbound wire transfers, purchase and redemption of \u201cticket-in/ticket-out\u201d documents.

He always followed a similar pattern whereby the stakes were high and the odds low. In other words, he bet on \u201cfavourites\u201d who were likely to win, although this likelihood meant that the sum received by the bet maker if he did win was relatively small. Consequently, he made a 7% net loss over a long period of time. This would be quite a serious loss for a professional gambler. He never received his winnings personally, but had cheques made out to a total of 14 different bank accounts in the names of 10 third parties. It was discovered that several of the cheques were issued in the names of the armed robbers and their immediate families. The link between the money launderer and the original criminals was established. The former was convicted of money laundering and sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. He had laundered approximately USD 3.3 million through the system.",

By arranging a hedging facility (a back-to-back loan) to hedge against currency fluctuations in two countries he used illegally earned, drug proceeds to operate in these real estate investments. Also, he arranged a bank guarantee between two banks in case of a default of the loan.

For all but the very smallest institutions with the most intimate customer relationships, information about customers and transactions should be captured in a systematic manner and incorporated into their compliance and risk management processes.

Such systems typically operate based on rules, scenarios and profiles that seek to measure and assess deviance of observed patterns from expected patterns, or seek to measure and assess conformity of observed patterns to known patterns of abuse of the financial system. Such systems need to be carefully configured to reflect the specific assessed risks of the Financial Institution. Such systems need to be continually evaluated and adjusted to maximize effectiveness, need to be continually updated with new operational and third-party information and need to be fully integrated into the Financial Institution\u2019s risk management process. When such systems generate alerts, it is important that the alerts are reviewed by the Financial Institution\u2019s Compliance Officer. While such system-generated alerts may be the cause for an STR, such alerts are not by themselves likely to form a complete STR in accordance with these guidelines and are not an acceptable substitute for such an STR..",

It can be a feeling that something is not as it was expected to be, or as it was explained to be, given the totality of knowledge of the circumstances in which that something exits. The feeling of doubt cannot be relieved by proof, one way or another, since no proof is available. The definition should allow formation of a belief that is not firmly grounded or perfectly clear.

Essay formats could be used for STR narratives i.e. having an introduction, a body, and a conclusion. Paragraph breaks can be used to divide the narrative into logical units and enhance readability. Within the body, information could be presented in a chronological manner when attempting to demonstrate possible causal links along a timeline. It is advised to minimize the use of Financial Institution\u2019s internal jargon and acronyms brandings, product names by using generic descriptors instead. For example, use \u201csix-month term deposit account\u201d rather than \u201cMega-Six Platinum Elite Plus Super Saver Account.\u201d Use punctuation and sentence case. Narrative should not be so brief as to compromise the goals of the narrative. It is advised to avoid words that do not contribute to the meaning of a sentence and to refrain from using too generic narratives such as \u2018the transaction pattern does not match with the customer profile\u2019.",
