Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018Part II - 3

The Central Bank was established as the authority responsible for the administration, supervision and regulation of the monetary, financial and payment systems of Sri Lanka under the Monetary Law Act. In accordance with this Act, the Bank is charged with the responsibility of securing the core objectives of economic and price stability and financial system stability.

The basis of accountability for the Central Bank and the success of its operations therefore would be the effectiveness of its policies and operations leading towards the achievement of its core objectives and not necessarily its profitability. These statutory objectives are the fundamental features that distinguish the Central Bank from any other entity, private or public. Accordingly, profitability related approach, if adopted by the Central Bank, could result in the Bank pursuing profits while compromising its core objectives, since it has the unique ability to create its own profits through its monetary policy activities, which could influence interest rates and exchange rates. It therefore

Central Bank of Sri LankaManagement StatementFor the period ended 31 December 2018

Accountability and the Financial Performance of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in relation to the Objectives

follows that the Central Bank’s objectives of economic and price stability and financial system stability need to be distinguished and detached from the pure profitability objective which should essentially be incidental or academic only.

In this background, the Central Bank’s financial statements record gains and/or deficits in the implementation of its monetary policy operations, exchange rate management, issuing of currency, etc. at the values as realized and hence, the financial performance as reported in these statements needs to be interpreted and understood in that context.

The Bank is subject to an external audit by the Auditor General under the Monetary Law Act sections 42 & 43. The Auditor General in turn has obtained the services of a firm of Chartered Accountants, M/s KPMG, to carry out an audit under International Standards of Auditing to ensure compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards.

Results of these activities are taken to Operating Activities in the context of the Statement of Income.

2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2.1 Statement of Compliance

These financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2018 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

This is the first set of the Financial Statements presented after the first time adoption of IFRS 9 – “Financial Instruments” and IFRS 15 – “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. Changes to significant accounting policies are described in Note 4.

2.2 Basis of Measurement

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the following,

• Gold is measured at fair value through profit

or loss (FVTPL).

• Derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are measured at fair value.

• Land and buildings are measured at cost

at the time of acquisition and subsequently at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

• Liability for defined benefit obligations is

measured as the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the plan assets.

2.3 Reporting Format

The Bank presents financial assets and financial liabilities, and their associated income and expense streams, by distinguishing between foreign currency and local currency operations. In the Statement of Financial Position, assets and liabilities are presented broadly in order of liquidity within such distinguished categories. The Bank considers that this reporting approach provides appropriate reporting of the Bank’s activities which are more fully described in Note 7.

2.4 Functional and Presentation Currency

The Financial Statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR), which is the Bank’s functional currency. Financial information presented in Sri Lankan Rupees has been rounded to the nearest thousand. There was no change in the Bank’s presentation and functional currency during the year under review.

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

2.5 Materiality and Aggregation

Each material class of similar item is presented separately in the Financial Statements. Items of dissimilar nature or function are presented separately unless they are immaterial.

2.6 Offsetting

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in Statement of Financial Position when, and only when, the Bank has a legal right to set off the recognized amounts and it intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

2.7 Comparative Information

The comparative information is reclassified whenever necessary to conform with the current year’s presentation.

3. USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The preparation of the Bank’s financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities.

Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively. Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognized in the financial statements are described in the following notes.

3.1 Classification and Impairment of Financial

Assets (Applicable from 1 January 2018)

The Bank used judgements when assessing the business model within which the assets are held and whether the contractual terms of the financial assets are Solely Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI) on the principal amount of the outstanding. The Bank also used judgements when establishing the criteria for determining whether credit risk on the financial assets has increased significantly since initial recognition, determining methodology for incorporating forward looking information into measurement of Expected Credit Losses (ECL) and selection and approval of models to measure ECL.

3.2 Pensions and Other Post Employment Benefit

Plans

The cost of defined benefit plans is determined using an actuarial valuation. The actuarial valuation involves

making assumptions about discount rates, future compensation increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. Assumptions used in the actuarial valuation are disclosed in Note 34 to the Financial Statements.

3.3 Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the Statement of Financial Position cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The inputs to these models are derived from observable market data where possible, but if this is not available, judgment is required to establish fair values. The judgments include considerations of liquidity and model inputs such as volatility for longer–dated derivatives.

4. CHANGES TO SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

There were no changes to the accounting policies and accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 related policies mentioned in detail below.

4.1 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

The financial statements of the Bank have been prepared based on the new accounting policies and methods which have been revised in line with the requirements of the IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments. The Bank complied with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement up to 31 December 2017, in the preparation of its annual Financial Statements.

Changes to Classification and Measurement

IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments and derivatives, to be assessed based on a combination of the entity’s business model for managing the assets and the instruments’ contractual cash flow characteristics. The IAS 39 measurement categories of financial assets (fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), available for sale (AFS), held to maturity, loans and receivables) have been replaced by:

• Financial Assets at amortized cost

• Debt Securities at Fair Value through Other

Comprehensive Income (FVOCI), with gains or losses recycling through Statement of Income on derecognition

• Equity instruments at FVOCI, with no recycling of gains or

losses through Statement of Income on derecognition

• Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

(FVTPL)

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018Part II - 13

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

The accounting for financial liabilities remains largely the same as it was under IAS 39. The Bank’s classification of its financial assets and liabilities and quantitative impact of applying IFRS 9 as at 1 January 2018 is disclosed in Note 8.

Changes to the Impairment Calculation

The adoption of IFRS 9 has changed the Bank’s accounting for impairments on financial assets by replacing the incurred loss approach of IAS 39 with a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. Detailed explanation of how the Bank has applied the impairment requirements of IFRS 9 is disclosed in Note 5.3.4

Transition

Changes in accounting policies resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively, except as described below:

• The Bank has not restated the comparative

information for 2017 for financial instruments in the scope of IFRS 9. Therefore, the comparative information for 2017 is reported under IAS 39 and is not comparable to the information presented for 2018. Differences arising from the adoption of IFRS 9 have been recognized directly in retained earnings as of 1 January 2018 and are disclosed in Note 8 to these financial statements.

• The following assessments have been made on the

basis of the facts and circumstances that existed at the date of initial application.

– The determination of the business model within which a financial asset is held.

– The designation of certain investments made in equity instruments as per the Section 105 A of the Monetary Law Act which are not held for trading as at FVOCI.

4.2 IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers

IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining, how much and when revenue is recognized. It replaced IAS 18 – “Revenue”, IAS 11 – “Construction Contracts“ and related interpretations. However, the timing or amount of the Bank’s fee and commission income from contracts with customers was not impacted by the adoption of IFRS 15. Accordingly, there was no impact on adoption of the said standard.

5. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies have been applied consistently by the Bank, except for the changes in accounting policies described in Note 4.

5.1 Foreign Currency Translations and Balances

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to Sri Lankan Rupees at the rate of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to Sri Lankan Rupees at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date. The foreign currency translation gain or loss on monetary items are taken to the Statement of Income. For the purposes of retranslation, as at the reporting date, the following Sri Lankan Rupee exchange rates for major currencies were used:

Currency2018Rs.2017Rs. 1 Australian Dollar128.8113119.37961 Canadian Dollar134.0153121.85981 Euro209.5593183.13531 Japanese Yen1.66611.35801 Special Drawing Rights (SDR)253.5111217.16081 Sterling Pound233.0792206.52211 United States Dollar182.7499152.85481 Chinese Yuan (Offshore)26.598823.4847

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

5.2 Fair Value Measurement

The Bank measures financial instruments, such as, foreign securities, derivatives and non-financial assets such as Gold, at fair value at each reporting date. The fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 53.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

• In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Bank.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018Part II - 14

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

The Bank uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.

Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Bank determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

5.3 Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

The Bank presents financial assets and liabilities, and the associated income and expense streams, by distinguishing between foreign currency and local currency activities. Foreign currency activities mainly arise from the Bank’s foreign reserves management function. Local currency activities mainly reflect the assets and liabilities associated with monetary policy implementation, issuing currency and banking activities.

The separate reporting of these activities is considered to provide a better presentation of the Bank’s financial position, financial performance and risk profile. The Bank considers that the combined reporting of foreign and local currency activities would weaken the informational value of the financial statements.

5.3.1 Recognition and Initial Measurement

All financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with the investment. Subsequent measurement bases for individual line items of financial assets after initial recognition are described after the policies applicable from 01 January 2018. All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the trade date respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases

or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.

5.3.2 (A) Classification

Policy applicable from 1 January 2018

Financial Assets

On initial recognition, Bank classifies the financial assets as measured at;

• Amortized Cost

• Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income

(FVOCI)

• Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)

A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL

• The asset is held within a business model whose

objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and

• The contractual terms of the financial asset give

rise on specified dates to cashflows that are Solely Payment of Principle and Interest.

A financial asset is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL.

• The asset is held within a business model whose

objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and

• The contractual terms of the financial asset give

rise on specified dates to cashflows that are Solely Payment of Principle and Interest.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. All other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL.

Business Model Assessment

The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes but not limited to:

• How the performance of the business model and

the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the entity’s key management personnel.

• The risks that affect the performance of the

business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018Part II - 15

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

• The frequency, volume and timing of sales in

prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realized.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

Assessment of whether Contractual Cash Flows are Solely Payments of Principal and Interest

The Bank assesses the contractual terms of Financial Assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. For the purpose of this assessment, ‘Principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and “Interest” is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs.

The most significant elements of interest within a lending arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgement and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest rate is set.

In contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than the minimum exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount outstanding. In such cases, the financial asset is required to be measured at FVTPL.

Reclassifications

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Bank changes its business model for managing financial assets.

5.3.2 (B) Classification

Policy applicable before 1 January 2018

Financial Assets

The Bank classified financial assets in one of the following categories under IAS 39,

• Loans and Receivables • Held to Maturity • Available for Sale or

• At fair value through profit or loss and within the

category as,

• Held for Trading or • Designated at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial Liabilities

The Bank classifies its financial liabilities, as measured at amortized cost.

5.3.3 Derecognition

Financial Assets

Bank derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI is recognised in profit or loss.

From 1 January 2018 any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI is not recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Bank is recognised as a separate asset or liability.

The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognized on its Statement of Financial Position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets or a portion of them. In such cases, the transferred assets are not derecognized. Examples of such transactions are securities lending and sale and repurchase transactions. In transactions in which the Bank neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Bank continues to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.

Financial Liabilities

The Bank derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired.

5.3.4 (A) Impairment of Financial Assets (Policy applicable from 1 January 2018)

The Bank recognises loss allowances for ECL on the following financial instruments that are not measured at FVTPL:

• Financial Assets at Fair Value through Other

Comprehensive Income

• Financial Assets at Amortized Cost

• Credit guarantee contracts of Regional Development

Department

No impairment loss is recognized on equity investments.

The Bank measures loss allowances at an amount equal to 12 months ECL for investments which are in investment grade (rated Baa3/BBB- and above). Majority of the investments of the bank which are classified as Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income and Amortized cost are above Baa3/BBB- rate. Financial instruments for which a 12-month ECL is recognised are referred to as ‘Stage 1 financial instruments’.

Life time ECL is calculated for those instruments which are below the investment grade at initial recognition or whose credit risk deteriorates below Baa3/BBB- or when a doubling of the probablity of default has ocurred after initial recognition. Financial instruments for which a lifetime ECL is recognised but which are not credit-impaired are referred to as ‘Stage 2 financial instruments’. Life time ECL would also be computed for credit impaired assets which would be referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial instruments’.

Measurement of ECL

The mechanism of the ECL calculations are outlined below with the key elements.

Probability of Default (PD): The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognized and is still in the portfolio. The bank uses specific equity PD’s of issuers/counterparties from Bloomberg for all its foreign investments at FVOCI and amoritzed cost and in the absence of equity PDs, the PD’s applicable to the rating of the specific issuer/counterparty from the Bloomberg common PD table at a given reporting date.

Exposure at Default: The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected draw downs on committed facilities and accrued interest from missed payments.

Loss Given Default (LGD): The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. The Bank has an approved internal policy in applying the LGD for different types of financial assets based on their risk exposure to the bank.

Economic Factor Adjustment: Bank uses the Economic Factor Adjustment for the conversion of Through the Cycle PD to Point in Time PD and the Bank mainly uses GDP data as the main economic factor in stimulating the PD.

Assessing the Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR)

Bank will consider that the financial instruments have significant increase in credit risk (SICR) when doubling of PD has occurred from initial recognition and any rating downgrade below BBB- after initial recognition. This is based on the observation that all ratings downgrades from an investment grade rating to a non-investment grade rating, including the marginal one notch downgrade from Baa3 to Ba1, results in a two-fold or greater increase of PD.

Credit-impaired financial assets

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost, at FVOCI, and credit guarantees, are credit-impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

• significant financial difficulty of the borrower or

issuer;

• a breach of contract such as a default or past due

event;

• it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter

bankruptcy or other financial reorganization

Presentation of allowance for ECL in the Statement of Financial Position

Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the Statement of Financial Position as follows:

• Financial assets measured at amortised cost: as a

deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets.

• Investments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance

is recognised in the Statement of Financial Position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance is disclosed and is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.

• Credit guarantee contracts: generally, as a provision.

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Write-off

Loans and debt securities are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level. Recoveries of amounts previously written off are included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’ in the Statement of Income and OCI.

5.3.4 (B) Impairment of Financial Assets (Policy applicable before 1 January 2018)

The Bank assessed at each reporting date whether a financial asset is impaired. If there was objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset shall be reduced either directly or through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss shall be recognized in the Statement of Income.

The Bank first assessed whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreased and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss was reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss was recognized in the Statement of Income, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset did not exceed its amortized cost at the reversal date.

If an Available for Sale asset was impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and amortization) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognized in the Statement of Income, was transferred from equity to the Statement of Income. Reversals in respect of equity

instruments classified as available for sale were not recognized in profit. Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments were reversed through the Statment of Income, if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in Statment of Income.

5.4 Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit

or Loss

Financial assets classified as held for trading are included in the category “securities at fair value through profit or loss”. Upon initial recognition, attributable transaction costs are recognized in the Statment of Income as incurred. These securities are subsequently valued at quoted market prices. Changes in market values are recognised as an increase or decrease in the value of the securities in the Statement of Financial Position while resulting gains and losses are recognised in the Statement of Income.

Where the security is still owned, the gain or loss is reported as “Gain/(Loss) from Unrealised Price Revaluations”. Where the gain or loss has been realised (through selling the security), it is reported as “Gain/(Loss) from realised Price Revaluations”.

5.5 Financial Assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income

Investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income are non-derivative investments that are designated as Fair Value through other Comprehensive Income or are not classified as another category of financial assets. Investments at Fair Value through other Comprehensive Income comprise equity securities and debt securities.

Foreign and Local Currency debt securities at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income are subsequently valued at quoted market prices. Changes in market value are recognised as an increase or decrease in the value of the Investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income in the Statement of Financial Position.

The equity investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income are subsequently valued based on the Net Assets of the respective institutions due to the non-availability of quoted prices.

Gains and losses arising from changes in the market value of Foreign and Local Currency debt securities and Equity Investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income are recognised directly in equity (Other Comprehensive Income) which is shown under Other Reserves in the Statement of Financial Position until the investment is sold, collected or otherwise disposed of, or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported as equity is included in Statement of Income with the exception of fair value changes in equity investments which will not be recycled to Statement of Income upon

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018Part II - 18

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

derecognition.

Interest income is recognised in Statement of Income using the effective interest method.

5.6 Instruments held at Amortized Cost

The items classified as Loans and Receivables and Held to Maturity instruments under IAS 39 are classified as Amortized Cost instruments under IFRS 9 and include loans given to banks/government and investments with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity that the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. These instruments are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

5.7 Derivative Instruments

The Bank uses derivatives such as cross currency swaps, currency options, forward foreign exchange contracts, for risk management purposes and not for speculative purposes. Derivatives are recorded at fair value and carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are included in ‘Gain/(Loss) from Unrealized Price Revaluations’.

When the transaction price differs from the fair value of other observable current market transactions in the same instrument, or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets, the bank immediately recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value (a Day 1 difference) in ‘Gain/(Loss) from Unrealized Price Revaluations’. In cases where fair value is determined using data which is not observable, the difference between the transaction price and model value is only recognised in the Statement of Income when inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.

5.8 International Monetary Fund (IMF) Related Balances

The Bank transacts with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its own right rather than as the depository of the Government of Sri Lanka. All transactions by the bank with the IMF have been included in these financial statements on that basis.

The bank records the quota with the IMF as an asset and the amount payable to the IMF for quota is recorded as a liability of the bank. The cumulative allocation of SDRs by the IMF is treated as a liability. All the IMF related assets and lliabilities are recognized at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Exchange gains and losses arising on revaluation of IMF assets and liabilities at the exchange rate applying at reporting date as published by the IMF are recognised in the Statement of Income.

All other charges and interest pertaining to balances with the IMF are recorded immediately in the Statement of

Income.

5.9 Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at foreign banks and financial institutions, short-term deposits and highly liquid financial assets with original maturities of less than three months, which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, and are used by the Bank in the management of its short-term commitments.Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost in the Statement of Financial Position.

As a part of local currency activities CBSL generates certain income and incurs expenses, which do not involve in movement of cash. Those activities result in certain assets and liabilities and mainly comprise of the transactions with the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and transactions with domestic banks and financial institutions. Transactions with GOSL include the purchase of Treasury bills and bonds that are issued by the Government as a monetary policy mechanism. Such purchases, disposals or interest thereon are reflected as mere book entries in the records of CBSL. These are disclosed separately in Note 47 and Note 48 to the Financial Statements.

As the sole statutory authority, CBSL issues currency to the public in line with Monetary Law Act. Currency issued by CBSL represents a claim on the bank in favor of the holder. This is a liability on the part of the CBSL while it is an item of cash in the hands of the holder. Movement in circulation currency is included as part of financing activities in line with prevailing industry practices among those central banks which present cash flow statements.

CBSL through the cash/pay order process disburses cash in the form of notes and coins or cheques drawn on CBSL, to various drawees including suppliers and employees for goods and services obtained, which is either added to the currency in circulation liability or deposits by banks and financial institutions. Such forms of utilization of currency for the purposes of CBSL’s payments form part of cash outflows of CBSL.

For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of cash/pay order outflows.

5.10 Repurchase and Reverse-Repurchase Transactions

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase continue to be recorded as assets in the Statement of Financial Position. The obligation to repurchase (Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase) is recognised as a liability. The difference between the sale and repurchase price in repurchase transactions and the purchase price and sale price in reverse-repurchase transactions represents an expense and income respectively and recognised in the Statement of Income.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018Part II - 19

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Securities held under reverse-repurchase agreements are recorded as an asset in the Statement of Financial Position (Securities Purchased under Resale Agreements). Both repurchase and reverse-repurchase transactions are reported at amortized cost inclusive of any accrued income or expense.

5.11 Standing Deposit and Lending Facilities

With effect from 1 February 2014, Standing Deposit Facility (former Standing Repurchase (Repo) Facility) was converted in to a ‘clean deposit’ with no allocation of collateral. Hence, participating institutions invest their excess funds in the Standing Deposit Facility as a clean deposit on daily basis at standing deposit facility rate.

The procedures of Standing Lending Facility (Formerly Standing Reverse Repurchase (Reverse Repo) Facility) are identical to the Standing Reverse Repurchase Facility and the both are recognized at amortized cost in the Statement of Financial Position.

5.12 CBSL Securities

The Bank issues CBSL Securities from time to time under its Monetary Policy operations to absorb excess liquidity in the market.

The securities issued are recorded as a liability. The difference between the issue price and the face value is recorded as an expense in the Statement of Income.

5.13 Sri Lanka Government Securities

Sri Lanka Government Securities consists of Treasury bills purchased from GOSL. Investments in Sri Lanka Government Securities is recorded in the Statement of Financial Position at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income.

5.14 Provisional Advances to Government

Advances to Government represents direct provisional advances made to GOSL under Section 89 of the Monetary Law Act No.58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka, as amended. These advances are subsequently measured at amortized cost.

5.15 Loans to Other Institutions

Loans granted to Other Institutions are recognized and carried at amortized cost.

5.16 Securities Borrowings and Securities Lending

Bank borrows Government Securities from time to time under its Monetary Policy operations from major institutional investors. The borrowed securities are used by the bank for repurchase operations to absorb excess liquidity in the market.

The securities borrowings is an unconditional blanket guarantee from the Bank for return of securities, payment

of agreed fee and on compensation at market rate (as per the market rates communicated to the primary market participants by the Public Debt Department of the Bank) in events of any failure in delivery.

The market values of the securities borrowed and not used for the repurchase operations at a particular time are recorded as a contingent liability. The commission paid is expensed on accrual basis.

Transfer of securities to counterparties under lending transactions is only reflected on the Statement of Financial Position if the risks and rewards of ownership are also transferred.

5.17 Staff Loans

Bank employees are entitled to loan facilities under concessionary interest rates. These loans which were granted from 2008 onwards are fair valued as per IFRS 9 using discounted cash flows.

Discount rate - The rate compiled by the Economic Research Department of CBSL (ERD) based on the long term inflation target on USD –Commercial Interest Reference Rate (CIRR) plus 1 per cent added for the risk premium as agreed by the Audit Committee of the Bank is used as the discount rate and it varies with the period of the loans.

The difference between the present value of the staff loan as at the end of a year and beginning of the year have been amortized yearly to record the expense incurred by the Bank in providing these loans at concessionary rates and equivalent amount is recorded as other income to record the income that would have been earned by the bank if these loans were granted at market rates.

Assumptions used for computation of fair valuation

• The date of staff loan granted is considered as 1

January.

• There were no amendments or early settlements.

5.18 Gold

Section 67 (1) of the Monetary Law Act which specifies the composition of the International Reserve indicates that gold may be held by the CBSL as part of this Reserve. Section 67 (2), Monetary Board is required to endeavor to hold at least a nuclear reserve in gold or currencies freely convertible by the Central Bank, whether directly or indirectly, in to gold as per the MLA. As this gold is part of the International Reserve and not used as a commodity which is traded during the normal course of business, gold is fair valued and the gains or losses are transferred to the Statement of Income. Prior to appropriation of profits, the unrealised gains from gold are transferred to

the relevant reserve account.

5.19 Inventories

5.19.1 Currency Inventory

Inventories of the Bank include new currencies that are not yet issued to the circulation. Cost related to production and design of new currency notes and coins are initially recognized at cost. Cost of new currency notes and coins which are issued to the circulation is determined on a weighted average basis and at the time of issue it is charged to Statement of Income. Allowance is made for slow moving inventories.

5.19.2 Other Inventories

Other inventories are carried at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.

5.20 Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, Plant and Equipment excluding land & building are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment in value. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of such Property, Plant and Equipment when that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met. Land and buildings are measured at revalued amount, being their fair value at the date of revaluation, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

Except for the freehold land, depreciation is calculated on a straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives.

Class of AssetUseful Life

Buildings on Freehold LandsOver 50 Years

Buildings on Lease hold landsLower of 50 years or over the lease hold periodPlant & Plant Integrals 20 Years Furniture & Equipment10 Years Motor Vehicles5 Years Motor Vehicles acquired 2014 onwards10 YearsComputer Hardware 4 Years Others3 Years

The carrying values of Property, Plant and Equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Policy for revaluation of Land & Building of the Bank is at least once in five years or at any shorter interval when a significant valuation adjustment becomes evident. Any revaluation surplus is credited to the Revaluation Reserve included in the equity section of the Statement of Financial

Position, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognized in Statement of Income, in which case the increase is recognized in Statement of Income. A revaluation deficit is recognized in Statement of Income, except that a deficit directly offsetting a previous surplus on the same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the Revaluation Reserve. Upon disposal, any revaluation surplus relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings.

An item of Property, Plant and Equipment is de-recognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the Statement of Income in the year the asset is de-recognized. The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, regularly.

Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. These are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred in the construction of buildings, major plant and machinery and system development, awaiting capitalisation.

5.21 Intangible Assets

Computer software not integral to computer hardware are shown as intangible assets and recognized at cost. Following initial recognition these intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment.

Subsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.

Amortisation is recognised in the Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the useful life of 4 years, from the date that it is available for use since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.

5.22 Other Assets

Other assets are carried at expected realisable values.

5.23 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets

The Bank assesses at each end of reporting period if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired, whether there is an indication that a non-financial asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the bank makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the Statement of Income.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018Part II - 21

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

5.24 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Bank expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.

5.25 Currency in Circulation

Currency issued by the Bank represents a claim on the bank in favour of the holder. The liability for Currency in Circulation is recorded at face value in the Statement of Financial Position.

5.26 Pension and Other Post Employment Benefit

Plans

Pension and other Post Employment Benefit Plans operated by the bank are disclosed in Note 34.

5.27 Defined Benefit Plans

A defined benefit plan is a post employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. Bank operates defined benefit schemes for Pension, Widows’ and Orphans’ Pensions (W&OP), Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pensions (WR&OP), Retirement Gratuity and Post Employment Medical Benefits. The Bank and eligible beneficiaries make contributions, to separately administered funds in respect of the first three schemes.

The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. The Bank’s obligation in respect of defined benefit plan is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the valuation date on Government Bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the average remaining years of service. All principal actuarial assumptions disclosed in Note 34 are revised only when a full actuarial valuation is performed.

5.28 Defined Contribution Plans

Employees are eligible for Employees’ Provident Fund Contributions and Employees’ Trust Fund Contributions in line with respective statutes and regulations. The bank contributes 24% and 3% of employees’ gross emoluments to Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund respectively which are separately administered defined contribution plans.

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as expense in the Statement of Income as and when they are due.

5.29 Grants

Grants recognised at their fair value (where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions, if any, will be complied with) are shown under equity. When the grant relates to an expense item it is recognised in the Statement of Income over the periods necessary to match them to the expenses it is intended to compensate on a systematic basis. Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is credited to a deferred government grant account and is released to the Statement of Income over the expected useful life of the relevant asset on a systematic basis consistent with the depreciation policy of the related asset.

5.30 Contingent Liabilities and Commitments

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events or present obligations where the transfer of economic benefit is not probable or cannot be reliably measured. All guarantees of indebtedness, forward foreign exchange transactions and other commitments, which are not recognized in Statement of Financial Position, are shown under respective headings disclosed as Contingent Liabilities and Capital Commitments items. Where applicable, such amounts are measured at best estimates.

STATEMENT OF INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

5.31 Revenue and Expenses

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Bank and the revenue can be reliably measured. Expenses are recognised in the Statement of Income on the basis of a direct association between the cost incurred and the earning of specific items of income. All expenditure incurred in the running of the business and in maintaining the property, plant & equipment in a state of efficiency has been charged to income in arriving at the result for the year.

The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue and expenses are recognised:

5.31.1 Interest Income and Expenses

Interest income and expenses are recognised in the Statement of Income for all interest bearing instruments on an accrual basis using the effective yield method based on the actual purchase price unless collectability is in doubt. Interest income includes coupons earned on fixed income investments and securities and accrued discount and premium on Treasury bills and other discounted instruments. Interest income is suspended when loans become doubtful of collection. Such income is excluded from interest income until received.

5.31.2 Dividends

Dividend income is recognised when the shareholder’s right to receive the payment is established.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018Part II - 22

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

5.31.3 Miscellaneous Income and Expenses

Miscellaneous income and expenses are recognised on an accrual basis.

Net gains and losses of a revenue nature on the disposal of Property, Plant & Equipment have been accounted for in the Statement of Income, having deducted from proceeds on disposal, the carrying amount of the assets and related selling expenses.

Gains and losses arising from incidental activities to the main revenue generating activities and those arising from a group of similar transactions which are not material, are aggregated, reported and presented on a net basis.

5.31.4 Personnel Expenses

Personnel Expenses include the full cost of all staff benefits. Salaries and related expenses due at year-end are included in other local payables.

5.31.5 Operating Leases

All the lease rentals on the operating leases are recognised in Statement of Income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.

5.31.6 Income Tax Expense

The income of the bank is exempted from tax under section 118 of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 as amended and as per section 7b (xvi) of Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 10 of 2006 and section 9(1) of Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017. In terms of the Economic Service Charge (amendment) Act No. 07 of 2017, CBSL is liable for ESC commencing from 1 April 2017. However, unrealized gain on exchange rate and unrealized marked to market gain on foreign currency financial assets are exempted from ESC with effect from October 2018 as per the ESC (amendment) Act No. 33 of 2018. Further, the bank is exempted from Value Added Tax on supply of financial services as per Value Added Tax (Amendment) Act No.17 of 2013.

5.32 Events Occurring after the Reporting Date

All material subsequent events after the reporting date have been considered and where appropriate adjustments or disclosures have been made in the respective notes to the financial statements.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

The cash flow statement has been prepared by using the “Direct Method” of preparing of cash flow statement in accordance with the IAS 7 - Statement of Cash Flow.

For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of cash/pay order outflows.

6. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT EFFECTIVE AS AT REPORTING DATE

The following standards and related interpretations issued, but not yet effective which is applicable to the Bank, up to the date of issuance of the Bank’s financial statements is disclosed below. The Bank intends to adopt the following standard, when it becomes effective.

6.1 IFRS 16 Leases

The IASB issued the new standard for accounting for leases - IFRS 16 Leases in January 2016. The new standard does not significantly change the accounting for leases for lessors. However, it does require lessees to recognise most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities, with the corresponding right of use assets. Lessees must apply a single model for all recognised leases, but will have the option not to recognise ‘short-term’ leases and leases of ‘low-value’ assets. Generally, the profit or loss recognition pattern for recognised leases will be similar to today’s finance lease accounting, with interest and depreciation expense recognised separately in the Statement of Income.

IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early application is permitted provided the new revenue standard, IFRS 15, is applied on the same date. Lessees must adopt IFRS 16 using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach.

The Bank does not anticipate early adopting IFRS 16 and is currently evaluating its impact.

7 NATURE AND EXTENT OF ACTIVITIES

7.1 Foreign Currency Activities

Foreign currency activities result mainly from the CBSL’s holdings of foreign currency assets under its foreign reserves management function. The foreign reserves management portfolio comprises foreign currency assets held for foreign exchange intervention purposes and other foreign currency assets held for trading purposes.

The foreign currency assets are held in various currencies. The majorities are denominated in United States Dollars, Australian Dollars, Euros, Sterling Pounds, Japanese Yen and New Zealand Dollars. The financial instruments held within these foreign currency portfolios consist mainly of sovereign securities, securities held under reverse-repurchase transactions or balances held with other central banks, commercial banks and custodial institutions.

The Bank also holds, from time to time, foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from international market operations.

7.2 Local Currency Activities

Local currency activities arise as follows: (i) Liquidity management operations: Liquidity management largely involves the CBSL offsetting the daily net flows to or from government or market by

8.1.1. The adoption of IFRS 9 has changed the impairment model of the Bank where by all assets calssified as Amortized Cost and FVOCI are subject to expected credit losses.

8.1.2. The Treasury Bill holding of the Bank which is held for open market operations was under the Held to Maturity category under IAS 39. This has been reclassified as FVOCI through the

transition to IFRS 9 due to the business model of the Treasury Bill holding.

8.1.3. Bank has certain equity investments in financial and other institutions which were classified as Available for Sale investments under IAS 39. This has been reclassified as FVOCI from the transition to IFRS 9.

amounts. The notional amount, recorded gross, is the amount of derivative’s underlying asset, reference rate or index and is the basis upon which changes in the value of derivatives are measured. The notional amounts indicate the volume of transactions outstanding at period end and are indicative of neither the market risk nor the credit risk.

11.2 The above derivatives consisting of Currency Swaps, Currency Options and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts were used for the purpose of managing market and liquidity risks in international reserves held by the Bank in line with the statutory objectives of maintenance of international reserves. In addition, the Bank entered into Swap transactions with Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), Licensed Specialized Banks (LSBs) and Foreign Central Banks in order to maintain international stability of the Sri Lankan Rupee, to strengthen the financial system of the country and to encourage those Banks to bring foreign funds.

11.3 Derivatives are financial contracts that derive their value in response to changes in interest rates, financial instruments prices, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit risk and indices.

11.4 A significant part of derivatives portfolio of the Bank consists of currency swaps entered into as a strategy to manage the short term liquidity requirements. In a currency swap, the Bank pays/receives a specified amount of a currency on an agreed date in exchange of another currency at agreed rates.

11.5 From Foreign Exchange Forward contracts, the Bank gets the obligation to buy or sell specific amount of foreign currency on an agreed future date at an agreed rate.

11.6 The Bank’s exposure to derivative contracts is closely monitored as part of the overall risk management of the Bank to ensure expected benefits from such derivatives are crystalized to the Bank.

147,427,452126,842,946

12.1 Holding of Special Drawing Rights

Holding of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) is potentially a claim on the freely usable currencies of IMF members in which holders of SDRs can exchange their SDRs for these currencies. The SDRs value as a reserve asset derives from the commitments of members to hold and accept SDRs, and to honor various obligations connected with the operation of the SDR system. The IMF ensures that the SDRs claim on freely usable currencies is being honored in two ways: by designating IMF members with a strong external position to purchase SDRs from members with weak external positions, and through the arrangement of voluntary exchanges between participating members in a managed market. The amount shown above represents the total holding of the Bank as at the respective reporting dates.

12.2 IMF Quota

The IMF Quotas (capital subscriptions) are the primary source of IMF resources received from its member countries. Each country’s quota is determined broadly on the basis of the relative economic size of the country. Upon joining the IMF, a country must pay 25 per cent of its quota in widely accepted foreign currencies or SDRs, and the remaining 75 per cent in its own currency. The IMF quota represents an asset of the Bank as it transacts with the IMF on its own account on behalf of the Government as per Articles of the IMF.

The IMF, based on the General Quota Review Agreement, decided to increase the quotas of each of the IMF’s 189 members in January 2016. As a result, Sri Lanka’s IMF quota increased to SDR 578.80 Mn on 17 February 2016 from the previous quota amount of SDR 413.40 Mn.

The amounts payable in respect of the IMF Quota is shown under the heading Quota Liability in Note 25. A member’s quota determines that country’s financial and organizational relationship with IMF, including:

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018Part II - 26

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

(i) Subscriptions: A member’s subscription to IMF resources is equal to its quota and determines the maximum amount of financial resources the member is obliged to provide to the IMF. A member must pay its subscription in full; up to 25 per cent must be paid in reserve assets specified by the IMF (SDRs or usable currencies), and the rest in the member’s own currency.

(ii) Voting power: The quota defines a member’s voting power in IMF decisions. IMF member’s votes are comprised of basic votes plus one additional vote for each SDR 100,000 of quota. The 2008 reform fixed the number of basic vote at 5.50 per cent of total votes.

(iii) Access to financing: The amount of financing a member can obtain from the IMF (access limits) is based on its quota. Under Stand-By and Extended Arrangements, for instance, a member can currently borrow up to 145 per cent of its quota annually and 435 per cent cumulatively. Access to finance may be higher in exceptional circumstances.

(iv) SDR allocations: Members’ shares of SDR allocations are established in proportion to their quotas.

12.3 Deposits with IMF – PRGF – HIPC Trust Deposit

The PRGF – HIPC (Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) Trust Deposit was made under the agreement between the GOSL and the IMF on 21 April 2000 by transferring SDR 788,783 from Sri Lanka’s deposit in the post SCA-2 (Special Contingent Account) administered account with the IMF. This account was created under the guidance of the IMF by transferring the balance held in SCA-2 against Sri Lanka when it was decided to wind up SCA-2 by the IMF. The IMF requested the countries that had balances in the Post SCA-2 account to consider providing the balances in that account to the PRGF/HIPC Trust either as outright grant or as a means of providing a subsidy for PRGF/HIPC Loan. Accordingly GOSL agreed to transfer the funds from Post SCA –2 accounts to PRGF/HIPC Trust account, not as an outright grant, but as an interest free deposit until 2018. This was later extended until 2024.

SDRs to supplement existing official reserve assets such as gold holdings, foreign exchange and reserve positions in the IMF. Under certain conditions, which are set in the Articles of Agreement signed on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka by the Bank, the IMF may allocate SDRs to members in proportion to their IMF quotas.

The Articles of Agreement also allow for cancellations of SDRs, but to date, this provision has not been used. Increases in Allocation of SDR represents increases in holding of SDR as described in Note 12. Members of IMF are obligated to pay to the IMF an amount equal to its net cumulative allocation and any other amounts that may be due and payable because of its participation in the Special Drawing Rights Department at the point of termination or liquidation of IMF’s SDR Department.

In the event of any further claims on Abandoned Properties, Bank is liable to pay deposits so collected with interest. Hence, the total deposit collected with the interest calculated on weighted average Treasury Bill interest rate is recorded as a liability of the Bank.

33. DEFERRED GRANTS

2018Rs. 0002017Rs. 000As at 1 January 45 80 Amortization during the year (34) (35)As at 31 December 11 45

Deferred grant is amortized over the period that matches with the depreciation policy of such assets. This includes the assets received by the Bank without any consideration. The fair value of the assets have been credited to a deferred grant account and taken to other income over the useful life of the relevant asset consistent with the depreciation policy of the related asset.

34. PENSION AND OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS

The Bank operates seven defined benefit plans which cover all eligible employees. Under the Employees’ Retirement Pension Scheme (old), employees who joined the Bank prior to 1 January 1998 and complete 10 years of service become eligible to the scheme. The employees who have joined the Bank after 1 January 1998 and complete 10 years of service become eligible for the new pension scheme. These pension schemes are non-contributory pension schemes where the cost of benefits is wholly borne by the Bank. The Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme for male employees and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme for female employees are open to employees of the Bank who had joined prior to 1 January 1998 whereas the new Widows’ and Orphans and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme

is open for employees of the Bank who joined after 1 January 1998. Eligible employees under the Widows’ and Orphans Pension Scheme (old) and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme (old) plans who were recruited before 1 August 1994 contribute 5% of the monthly basic salary & employees who were recruited on or after 1 August 1994 contribute 10% of the monthly basic salary whereas the eligible employees under the new Widows’ and Orphans and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme contribute 5.5% of the monthly basic salary.

The Bank also provides gratuity benefits to employees who have completed five years of service in the Bank and who are not eligible for a monthly pension payment under the Employees’ Retirement Pension Schemes. In order to meet this liability, a provision is carried forward in the Statement of Financial Position, equivalent to the liability calculated using the actuarial valuation.

The Bank has a Post-Employment Medical Benefit Scheme which provides reimbursement of certain medical expenses incurred by retired employees on account of themselves or their spouses and by widows/widowers.

The Bank employed an Independent Actuary M/s K. A. Pandit, Consultant & Actuary (Mumbai) to re-assess the defined benefit obligations and the current service costs attributable to the Employees’ Retirement Pension Schemes, Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme, Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme, Gratuity Scheme and Medical Benefit Scheme during the year. The bank employed the same Independent Actuary to asess the defined benefit obligations of the new Widows’ and Orphans’ and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension scheme for the first time during the year.

Funds of the Employee Retirement Pension Schemes, Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme, Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme are managed separately and separate books are maintained. However, Gratuity Scheme and Medical Benefit Scheme are not separated from the books of accounts of the Bank. Further, investments and investment income are recorded separately for these funds in the Bank books and the income earned from the investments are transferred back to these funds and reinvested without being distributed.

The total present value of all benefit obligations of Rs. 48,245.66 Mn (2017 – Rs. 38,392.29 Mn) exceeds the total fair value of plan assets of Rs. 38,884.03 Mn (2017 – Rs. 40,816.60 Mn) at the end of the reporting period resulting in a deficit of Rs. 9,361.63 Mn (2017 – surplus of Rs. 2,424.31 Mn).

The balance shown under Pension and Other Post Employment Benefit Plans in Statement of Financial Position differs from the net liability as per the actuary due to the following reasons:

a) The net asset position of the and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme is not reflected in the accounts due to the remote possibility of distributing any residual balance of the fund to the bank.

b) For both gratuity and medical benefit schemes, the accounts represent the gross liability position and not the net liability as per actuary, since the Bank does not keep relevant assets in a separate fund (internally maintained).

The balance of Rs. 1.0 Bn is allocated to implement a special credit guarantee scheme to support lending to Small and Medium Enterprises by Commercial Banks.

x). Reserve for Funding purpose of Post Employment Benefit Plans : As per Monetary Board decision MB/F/39/20/2016 dated 16 December 2016, it is proposed to allocate 50 per cent of the benefit expenses of the actuary of a given year (starting from 2016) to a separate reserve, if there are adequate distributable profits with a view to compensate the possible negative impact to the equity attributed to actuarial losses and benefit expenses. Accordingly, CBSL has transferred an amount of Rs. 0.37 Bn in 2017. An additional amount of Rs. 5.0 Bn was transferred in anticipation of the possible impact to the equity of the bank from the Actuarial valuation of the guaranteed return of the Employee Provident Fund.

Accordingly, an amount of Rs.19.43 Bn has been transferred to Retained Earnings from MRR in view of improving the negative Retained Earnings of the Bank.

v). RTGS Sinking Fund : This fund is built up with the charges collected from the participants for the use of the RTGS system.

vi). Pension Fund Reserve : This reserve is made up by transferring an additional Rs.3.0 Bn from 2007 profits to be used to meet any shortfalls in the pension fund given the vulnerability of the income generating capacity of the Bank to external risks. Another Rs. 1.0 Bn have been transferred to this reserve from 2011 profits.

50. RISK MANAGEMENT

In pursuing Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s (CBSL) policy objectives, it faces various risks, both financial and non-financial in nature. Since the materialization of any of these risks could have a severe impact on the financial position and the reputation of CBSL, a properly designed risk management framework is vital for CBSL. Recognizing the strategic importance of an integrated approach to risk management, led to the creation of a separate Risk Management Department (RMD) at CBSL in 2015 to overcome the conventional management of viewing risk in silos. Accordingly, risk management was recognized as a key strategic priority of the CBSL for 2018-2020 and the Bank is in the process of implementing an Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) Framework for CBSL. This framework is intended to promote a culture of informed risk-taking at all levels of the Bank.

The Risk Governance Framework which was approved by the Monetary Board in July 2018 comprises both a Risk Governance Structure and a Risk Management Structure and covers both, financial and non-financial risks confronted by the Bank.

The Risk Governance Structure consists of the Monetary Board (MB), and two Board sub-committees, the Board Risk Oversight Committee (BROC) and the Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee (MBAAC). The MB holds the ultimate responsibility for the overall risk management function of the Bank and sets the “Tone at the Top”. Further, MB is responsible for setting the Risk Appetite and Risk Tolerance level for CBSL and approving the risk management/compliance framework.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018Part II - 44

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

The BROC was set up in August 2018 and is chaired by Mr. Chrishantha Perera, independent member of the Monetary Board and comprises external experts (Mr. Ravi Abeysuriya, Director HNB Assurance from 01.08.2018 to 05.10.2018 and Mr. Priyan Fernando, Chairman Brandix and Senior Advisor, Boston Consulting Group from 05.10.2018 onwards). The BROC oversees CBSL’s overall Risk Management and Compliance Functions via a formal delegation from the MB, and is responsible for laying the broad strategy and policies for the Bank’s risk management and compliance functions. The BROC also assists the MB to ensure a dedicated focus on risk management and compliance at the Bank.

The Risk Management Structure that has been put in place follows the Three Lines of Defense model. In the first line of defense, operational departments are expected to identify, assess, control and mitigate risks and implement internal policies and procedures to ensure that activities carried out are consistent with the Bank’s goals and objectives. The Risk Management Department assists in monitoring the implementation of effective risk management practices by operational management and independently reports risk related issues to the Risk Governance Structure creating a link between the Risk Management and Risk Governance Structures. The third line of defense, Internal Audit provides assurance on the effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal controls, including the manner in which the first and second lines of defense achieve risk management and control objectives. Each of these three ‘lines’ plays a distinct role within the Bank’s risk governance framework.

In addition to facilitating non-financial risk management of all the departments under the three lines of defense model, RMD is also responsible for the financial risk management of the fund management activities of the International Reserves (IR), and the Internal Investment Funds (IIF) of CBSL, as well as the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) which is carried out as an agency function for the Government. RMD revised the Investment Policy Statements (IPS) and Investment Guidelines (IG) for the EPF and IIF and set up Investment Oversight Committees (IOCs) to oversee these fund management activities. RMD also independently monitored market and credit risks pertaining to these fund management activities and reported risks emanating from them to the management. Market and credit risk indicators were presented at the monthly meetings of the Foreign Reserves Management Committee, where observations, from a risk perspective, on investment strategies and global market developments, were conveyed to the Committee. Similar meetings were convened for the IOCs of the EPF and IIF on a monthly basis, where risks and compliance issues pertaining to their investments were discussed.

In line with the new framework, RMD prepared a Risk Management Policy Statement (RMPS) for the CBSL, setting out the policies for implementation of risk management across CBSL. In this process, CBSL follows accepted standards and guidelines for managing risks, while assigning risk ownership and management among different stakeholders with clear accountability.

A survey was conducted amongst the Monetary Board and management of CBSL to determine the top bank-wide non-financial risks impacting the CBSL. The survey results would be used to develop a Risk Taxonomy for CBSL, which would help prioritize the bank-wide non-financial risk categories affecting CBSL and enable the management to concentrate on key risk categories that impact the institution.

Recognizing the importance of creating a risk culture within the bank, RMD conducted several risk awareness programs for CBSL staff throughout the year at various fora, with the involvement of RMD staff and external resource personnel.

With a view to strengthen the operational risk management function, RMD would secure technical assistance from the World Bank’s Operational Risk Team to enhance risk governance and develop a risk management framework for the CBSL.

Going forward, RMD will continue to strive to create an environment to ensure that emerging risks that will have a material impact on

the CBSL, and any risk-taken beyond the risk appetite of the CBSL, would be recognized, escalated and addressed in a timely manner.

RMD will work with the operational departments to develop Risk Registers in a phased-out manner. Risk registers would enable the measurement of risk in a more consistent and uniform manner across all the operations in the bank. It would also provide risk information to the management to enable timely assessment and treatment of risks.

RMD will implement an Incident Reporting Mechanism in early 2019, to facilitate reporting of risk incidents affecting the CBSL to the management and to ensure that appropriate actions are implemented to address the causes of such incidents. This on-line Incident Reporting System, would be accessible to staff at all levels. This would facilitate the development of a central repository of risk events within the CBSL to serve as a basis for analyzing and assessing risk incidents, tracking progress on the implementation of corrective actions, identifying possible trends and areas of vulnerabilities and improving risk reduction measures.

With respect to financial risk management, RMD will further strengthen the risk management framework of the fund management activities and is in the process of reviewing the investment policies and guidelines for each of the funds managed by CBSL. RMD’s focus would be on revisiting the credit risk policies and guidelines with a view to improving the credit risk management framework of the fund management activities of CBSL, covering CBSL’s counterparties, issuers and custodians. In the meantime, RMD would continue to monitor credit and market risks pertaining to investments on an ongoing basis to ensure they are within the stipulated limits specified by the Monetary Board approved Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA), IPS and IG and highlight risks to the management at all times.

50.2 Interest Rate Risk

(a) Foreign Currency Interest Rate Sensitivity

Interest rate risk is the risk of loss arising from the changes in interest rates.

The interest rate sensitivity of the Fixed Income Securities portfolio, except the investment in Reserve Advisory Management Program (RAMP), is measured by the potential gain or loss that could incur due to a change in interest rate by 10 basis points. The interest rate sensitivity of the fixed income securities portfolio held under RAMP is meaured by the potential gain or loss that could incur due to a change in interest by 1 basis point. Sensitivity of the risk exposure of the segmented Fixed Income Securities Portfolio is given below:

Portfolio SegmentPotential Loss (USD Mn)20182017Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income/Available for Sale7.867.55

RAMP0.030.03

RMD manages the interest rate risk of the foreign assets portfolio by employing the following strategies:i) While the interest rate sensitivity measures the effect of a change in interest rates on the foreign assets portfolio, the Bank uses Modified Duration (MD) as a measurement of interest rate risk which considers interest rates as well as the duration of an investment. The MD measures the change in price of a security for a 1% change in the interest rates (yield). A higher MD indicates a higher risk. Hence, the Bank sets an appropriate MD from time to time considering the developments in the financial markets, portfolio characteristics and the risk appetite of the bond portfolio. The MDs of the foreign assets portfolio are tabulated below:

Modified Duration

Investment SegmentModified Duration20182017Capital Market (Fixed Income Securities)2.082.02RAMP1.411.39

ii) Since the MD does not account for large changes in prices, another measure used for management of interest rate risk of the foreign reserves portfolio is convexity. Convexity measures the extent of deviation in bond price-yield curve from a straight line representing duration. It allows improving the duration approximation for bond price changes. Convexity is a change in Duration for a change in yield. It measures the predictive error of Modified Duration. In other words, it is the second derivative of a security’s price with respect to its yield.

RAMP0.040.04

iii) Value at Risk (VaR)

VaR summarizes in a single number the downside risk of the portfolio, under normal market conditions, from financial market movements. Therefore, VaR is the maximum loss over a target horizon such that there is a low, pre-specified probability that the actual loss will be larger. VaR gives a number, in terms of money, which can be aggregated across risks and positions. The Bank uses Monte Carlo method to calculate VaR number for 10 days period at 99% confidence interval for its fixed income securities portfolio except for the investment in RAMP. The VaR of the fixed income securities portfolio held under RAMP is measured using the Monte Carlo method for one month period at 99 % confidence interval.

Portfolio SegmentValue at Risk (VaR) (USD) Mn20182017Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income/Available for Sale19.9422.98

RAMP0.780.64

iv) Trading & Open Position Limits

Bank assigns specific dealer limits on intra-day and overnight position limits for individual dealers by way of “Dealing Authority “.

Interest rate risk measures related to the investments in the Reserve Advisory Management Program (RAMP) is reported to the Foreign Reserve Management Committee on a regular basis.

(b) Local Currency Interest Rate Sensitivity

The local Treasury Bill portfolio is recorded in the Statement of Financial Position of the Bank at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income as per the Business Model assessment under IFRS 9. This portfolio is not an investment portfolio, as the Bank does not purchase Treasury Bills with the intention of earning an interest income. The Bank purchases or sells Treasury Bills to inject rupee liquidity into the domestic market or to absorb liquidity from the market in the course of carrying out its monetary policy operations in relation to one of its core objectives, maintaining economic and price stability. Hence, the volume of Treasury Bills in the Bank’s portfolio is determined by its monetary policy operations. In addition, the basic interest rates in the rupee market, the Repo rate and the Reverse Repo rate are policy rates determined by the Bank in the course of implementing its monetary policy. Moreover, the Bank’s actions in injecting rupee liquidity or absorbing liquidity from the market have a significant impact on general rupee market interest rates. Thus, changes in the interest income earned from the Treasury Bill portfolio, which arise from changes in the volume of the Bank’s Treasury Bill portfolio, as well as changes in interest rates, are primarily a consequence of the Bank’s monetary policy actions, rather than due to investment decisions. Therefore, the Bank does not consider interest rate sensitivities arising from local currency assets.

50.3 Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency activities result mainly from the Bank’s holding of foreign currency assets under its foreign reserve management function. Volatility of the foreign exchange markets may expose the Bank to exchange risk. The Monetary Board and Foreign Reserves Management Committee (FRMC) have set percentage holdings of different currencies in its International Reserves. In

deciding on the currency allocation, public debt repayment requirements are given due consideration. Accordingly, the Bank holds most major currencies such as US Dollars, Sterling Pounds, Japanese Yen, Euro, Australian Dollars and New Zealand Dollars. Compliance with limits established for foreign currency positions are monitored.

50.5 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the difficulty that an entity will encounter in raising funds at short notice to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. Liquidity risk is also the risk that an entity will have to sell a financial asset quickly at much less than its fair value

a) Liquidity is a key consideration in determining the composition of the Bank’s foreign currency assets. This reflects the potential requirement to liquidate foreign reserves for intervention purposes and to settle other commitments such as public debt and IMF Loan repayments when the need arises. The Bank has adopted the following measures aimed at ensuring quick access to funds:

• Liquid asset ratios based on the liquidity characteristics of securities held

• Limits on maximum proportion of reserves that may be held in one currency and with one counterparty

b) In order to reduce the level of liquidity risk arising out of the local currency activities, particularly open market operations, the Bank uses highly liquid marketable instruments such as Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds as collateral. It manages the daily liquidity position of the banking system by way of infusing into or withdrawal from the system, using instruments such as repo / reverse repo, CBSL securities and USD /LKR Swaps.

53. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

53.1 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

‘Fair Value’ is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Bank has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk

The determination of fair value for financial assets and liabilities for which there is no observable market price requires the use of valuation techniques as described in accounting policy Note 5.2 For financial instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective, and requires varying degrees

of judgement depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumptions and other risks affecting the specific instrument. The fair value hierarchy of financial instruments is given below:

Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

Level 3: Fair value measurements using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

Land & Buildings

Valuation MethodLand is valued using market approach with direct comparison method, whereby assets are compared to recent sales with no added or nominal added improvement value, making adjustments for points of difference to derive the fair value.

Depreciated Current Replacement Cost (DRC) method is used in valuing all the buildings except Central Point, White Aways and Lloyds Building, considering that the assets controlled by the public sector entities that provide service to the community are not traded on an open liquid market.

Income approach is used to value the other buildings which values the property based on estimated future income, profits or cash flow that are converted (discounted) to a single current amount.

Under the Market Approach, estimated fair value would get increased/(decreased) if;

Price per perch would get higher/(lower)Price per square foot would get higher/(lower)Depreciation rate for building would get lower/(higher)Under Income Approach, estimated fair value would get increased/(decreased) if;

Gross annual rentals would get higher/(lower)Years purchase would get higher/(lower)

Derivatives

Derivative valuation models use forward prices (calculated by extrapolating the forward points available in the market) and discount rates calculated based on zero coupon yield curves of the respective currencies as of the valuation date. If the instrument that is valued contains a margin, adjustments are made to the forward prices and/or the interest rates to represent the impact of the margin rate.

a. Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions are performed as part of the Monetary Policy operations of the Bank and continues to be recognized in their entirety under “Sri Lanka Government Securities” in the Statement of Financial Position because it retains substatially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.

Currently a selected Clearing House (CH) functions as the custodian for the supranational bonds and bonds issued by different issuers. CBSL has signed an agreement which enable CH to lend at their wish depending on the demand for those bonds. Since the lending does not involve CBSL and CH lends them directly to the borrowers, the process is called auto bond lending. At the end of each month, custodian will send fee income for auto bond lending, if any for the bonds which they lent under auto bond lending programme. The Bank continues to recognize the securities in their entirety in the Statement of Financial Position because it retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. These securities are presented in the Statement of Financial Position as “Securities at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income”.

2. BANK SUPERVISION

Bank Supervision Department (BSD) was established under Section 28 of the Monetary Law Act (MLA) for the purpose of continuous supervision and periodic examination of licensed banks in Sri Lanka. Regulations and supervision of licensed banks are governed by the provisions of the Banking Act, No. 30 of 1988 as amended.

The main duties of BSD include formulating and implementing prudential regulations, conducting continuous supervision and periodic statutory examinations of banks, approving the fitness and propriety of Directors, Chief Executive Officers and Key Management Personnel (KMPs) of licensed banks, granting regulatory approvals and taking regulatory actions where necessary with the approval of the Monetary Board, and engaging in awareness and capacity building of the banking sector.

As at the end 2018, the banking sector comprised 26 licensed commercial banks (LCBs) and 7 licensed specialised banks (LSBs) operating under the regulatory and supervisory purview of BSD. In addition, as at end 2018, 3 Representative Offices (ROs) of foreign banks were in operation in Sri Lanka. The list of licensed banks and ROs is provided in Annex II-1.

A summary of the main functions and activities performed by BSD during 2018 is given below:

2.1 Issuance of Prudential Regulations

Prudential regulations issued to licensed banks are provided in Part III of this Report. A summary of the major prudential regulations issued during the year is as follows.

(a) Loan to Value Ratios for Credit Facilities in respect of Motor Vehicles

Licensed banks were required to maintain Loan to Value (LTV) ratios, when granting credit facilities for purchase or utilisation of motor vehicles as a macro-prudential measure to curtail the excessive credit in the banking sector for purchase of motor vehicles. Several amendments to these requirements were introduced from time to time in 2018.

Accordingly, revised LTV ratios were introduced which are applicable for credit facilities in respect of motor vehicles including electric, hybrid and other unregistered vehicles and registered vehicles that have been used in Sri Lanka for more/less than one year after the first registration. Further, measures were taken to curtail imports of motor vehicles and non-essential consumer goods to minimise the adverse impact on the exchange rate by lowering LTV ratios and requesting to refrain from opening of letters of credit for importation of motor vehicles under the scheme for issuance of motor vehicle permits on concessionary terms issued by the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL).

In addition, licensed banks were informed to refrain from the issuance of Usance Letter of Credit facility for the importation of motor vehicles as proposed by the budget 2018. Nevertheless, exemptions from LTV ratios were granted for identified economic sectors that required importation of vehicles for their core business operations. The applicability of LTV ratio was also waived off for procurement of vehicles for government agencies and concessionary vehicle loan schemes introduced by the government on a need basis.

(b) Off-shore Banking Business Schemes

A Banking Act Order was issued to all LCBs permitting transactions that are allowed under the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Act No. 12 of 2017, in any designated foreign currency, in an account of a non-resident maintained in an off-shore banking unit.

(c) Regulatory Framework for Appointment of Agents

A regulatory framework was introduced on the appointment of agents of licensed banks, including the approval and selection process of agents and sub agents, responsibilities of banks, permitted activities to be performed by agents and sub agents, risk management and oversight, customer protection, compliant measures and relief mechanism. Subsequently, an amendment to the Direction was issued permitting licensed banks to provide inward remittance services to persons other than existing customers.

(d) Strengthening Risk Management of Derivative Transactions

Licensed banks were instructed to adopt more stringent risk management measures for derivative transactions and the Directions issued in this regard cover the areas such as commencement of derivative transactions, board approved policies and procedures, customer awareness, prohibited activities and reporting requirements when engaging in financial derivative transactions. Previous Directions issued in this regard were revoked.

(e) Margin Requirements against Imports on Documents against Acceptance (DA) Terms

Licensed banks were required to take measures to curtail imports of non-essential consumer goods and minimise the adverse impact on the exchange rate, introducing a cash margin requirements of 100 per cent for imports on DA.

(f) Annual Licence Fee of Licensed Commercial Banks and Licensed Specialised Banks

Licensed banks were informed of the increase in annual licence fees of the licensed banks for the calendar years 2019 and 2020, based on the total assets of licensed banks, as at end of the previous year.

(g) Introducing Net Stable Funding Ratio under Basel III Liquidity Standards

With a view to ensuring a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of assets and off-balance sheet activities of banks, licensed banks were required to adopt Net Stable Funding Ratios (NSFR) in accordance with Basel III liquidity standards. Accordingly, licensed banks were required to meet NSFR of 90 per cent by 01 January 2019 and increase it to 100 per cent by 01 July 2019.

(h) Amendments to Directions on Liquidity Coverage Ratio under Basel III Liquidity Standards

Banks were informed of the amended regulatory reporting formats on Liquidity Coverage Ratio under Basel III Liquidity Standards.

(i) Foreign Currency Borrowings by Licensed Banks

Commencing 30 November 2018, licensed banks were required to comply with a new policy on foreign currency borrowings, with a view to further strengthening risk management of foreign currency borrowings by banks. The short and long term limits on foreign currency borrowings were introduced, based on a score that was calculated by considering the bank’s external credit rating and capital adequacy ratio, and linked to a certain percentage of total assets. With respect to foreign currency borrowings by off-shore units, licensed banks were informed to engage in the business of foreign currency borrowings and borrowings with residents subject to terms and conditions in Banking Act Direction No. 11 of 2018 on Foreign Currency Borrowings by licensed banks.

(j) Introducing Leverage Ratio under Basel III for Licensed Banks

Commencing 01 January 2019, licensed banks were required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3 percent in accordance with Basel III leverage ratio framework to act as a credible supplementary measure to the risk based capital requirement.

(k) Adoption of Sri Lanka Accounting Standards – SLFRS 9: Financial Instruments

Guidelines on the adoption of Sri Lankan Accounting Standards – SLFRS 9: Financial Instruments were issued to licensed banks on 31 December 2018 with a view to establishing consistent and prudent practices on the adoption of Sri Lankan Accounting Standards in the banking sector.

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 73

through the web based FinNet System. Approximately, 70 statutory returns are submitted monthly/quarterly/annually by each bank through the FinNet system covering financial and prudential information. Revamping of the database maintained in BSD continued in 2018 in order to facilitate better report generation.

Further, monthly presentations on the banking industry performance were also prepared.

d) During 2018, approximately 795 customer complaints/requests were handled relating to loan interest rates, rescheduled loans, credit cards, pawning operations, banking malpractices and frauds, unauthorised withdrawal of funds and seeking reduction in Automated Teller Machine (ATM) charges and fees.

In addition, 17 meetings were held with licensed banks to discuss regulatory concerns identified by the continuous supervision function.

2.4 Conduct of Periodic Examinations

(a) BSD conducted 32 examinations during 2018 including 05 that continued from the previous year. Examinations of 27 licensed banks were completed in 2018 through formal discussions with the management of the respective banks and submission of reports to the Monetary Board, while 05 examinations were in the process of completion. Major concerns raised at certain examinations included low capitalization and efficiency, lapses in corporate governance and management, deficiencies in technology risk management and liquidity risk management, under-estimation of non-performing loans and provision for bad and doubtful loans and concerns over treasury operations. In addition, several examinations with limited scope were conducted on areas such as investments in government securities, corporate governance, customer complaints, trade finance transactions, foreign exchange operations and credit facilities granted for purchase of motor vehicles.

(b) Further, BSD has developed a supervisory rating model for licensed banks viz, Bank Sustainability Rating Indicator (BSRI) which was approved by the Monetary Board to facilitate the risk based supervision framework of licensed banks and to enable early intervention and prompt corrective action through identification of potential risks arising from emerging developments and strategic changes of licensed banks. Accordingly, risk based examinations based on BSRI commenced with effect from 01 January 2019.

5. CURRENCY

The CBSL has the sole right and authority to issue currency in Sri Lanka which includes both currency notes and coins as stipulated in the MLA No. 58 of 1949. In fulfilling this task, CBSL is entrusted with designing, printing of currency notes, minting of coins and distributing of currency notes and coins. Currency Department (CRD) of CBSL handles functions relating to this statutory responsibility of the Monetary Board. CRD continuously engages in building and maintaining public confidence in the currency by preserving its value and integrity and making available adequate stocks to meet the demand for currency, which is essential for smooth functioning of the economy.

5.1. Currency Printing and Minting

In order to ensure good quality notes in circulation and ensure sufficient stocks to meet the public demand, during 2018, 121 million pieces of currency notes and 311.4 million pieces of coins were printed/minted and received by CRD. A new set of circulation standard coins which are made of stainless steel for the denominations of Rupee 1, Rupees 2, Rupees 5 and Rupees 10 designed and procured in 2016-2017, was issued into circulation on 03 December 2018 through LCBs. This new coin series was designed with the objectives of reducing the cost of minting coins, increasing the durability of coins, giving more portability and providing easy identification by visually impaired people.

5.2. Currency Distribution

(a) Currency in Circulation

Demand for currency notes and coins increased in 2018 in line with the economic growth and inflation in Sri Lankan economy, notwithstanding the continued usage of technology driven non-cash modes of payment. Accordingly, the value of total currency in circulation increased by 7.2 per cent to Rs.640.3 billion as at 31 December 2018, over the previous year, as shown in Table II-4 below.

5.3 Clean Note Policy

CRD continued the implementation of the Clean Note Policy during the past several years with the objective of ensuring good quality currency notes in circulation in the country, while withdrawing unfit/unserviceable currency notes from circulation. Accordingly, CRD initiated several actions to strengthen the

Clean Note Policy in 2018, as clean currency notes in circulation reflect a positive image of the country.

During 2018, CRD continued to ensure the regular supply of good quality (fit) currency notes and disposal of unfit currency notes, by destroying 343.8 million pieces of unfit currency notes deposited by LCBs, amounting to a face value of Rs. 252.2 billion2. Additionally, CRD re-issued 231.5 million pieces of serviceable currency notes amounting to Rs 467.0 billion in to circulation which was deposited by LCBs.

CRD took measures to strictly enforce the law on willfully mutilation, alteration and defacement of currency notes, considering the increased number of willfully mutilated, altered and/or defaced currency notes among the currency deposits of LCBs on a regular basis.

A sound awareness campaign was conducted to educate the general public to refrain from such practices and informed to exchange such currency notes in their possession by 31 December 2018.

5.4 Assistance Provided to Law Enforcement Authorities

During 2018, CRD continued facilitating law enforcement authorities regarding violation of the provisions of the MLA on counterfeiting of currency as follows:

(a) Closely co-operated with the Counterfeit Currency Bureau of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Police and law enforcement authorities pertaining to counterfeiting attempts. Counterfeit notes detected in 2018 amounted to 1,625 pieces. The ratio of counterfeit currency notes in circulation which is measured by pieces per million decreased to 1.6 during 2018 compared to 5 which was in 2017.

(b) Endorsed and issued 108 certificates in terms of section 59 of the MLA with the signature of the Governor of the CBSL, as conclusive evidence for the imitation of currency note, to facilitate proceedings in courts.

(c) Attended 15 court cases to give evidence on currency counterfeiting.

CRD initiated actions to ensure the inspection of every single currency note at the end of the production line at the printer, in order to enhance the quality standard of the currency notes issued by the CBSL. As another step closer to automation of currency processing, CRD initiated to revamp the currency processing with the introduction of high-tech machines in order to improve efficiency and effectiveness of currency operations at CRD. 6. DOMESTIC OPERATIONS

6.1 Functions of DOD

As per the MLA, Domestic Operations Department (DOD) carries out several main functions, which include conducting Open Market Operations (OMO), providing standing facilities, regulating statutory reserves of commercial banks, acting as the banker and the official depository of the government, government agencies and other institutions, acting as banker to the commercial banks, providing temporary advances to the government, maintaining settlement accounts for Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) participants and providing intraday liqidity facility to RTGS participants.

6.2 Implementation of Monetary Policy

With the objective of maintaining short-term interest rates at a level commensurate with the prevailing monetary policy stance of the CBSL, DOD continued to implement monetary policy. DOD relied mainly on OMO, in signalling and steering Average Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR), which serves as the operating target of the enhanced monetary policy framework, towards desired level in a low volatility environment. Meanwhile, standing facilities were provided continuously to market participants to address liquidity needs on overnight basis. Accordingly, monetary policy operating procedure in 2018 continued to evolve in the midst of some changes in the nature and frequency of use of OMOs, policy rates, width of the corridor, the manner of policy signals, enhanced transparency, etc.

To ease the pressure on the foreign exchange market, margin requirement was imposed in September 2018 against Letters of Credit for importation of motor vehicles and non- essential consumer goods. Accordingly, LCBs were required to maintain minimum cash margin of 200 per cent for importation of motor vehicles and 100 per cent for importation of non-essential consumer goods. Further, LCBs were required to maintain minimum reserves of 100 per cent of such margin deposits with effect from 16 October 2018.

Access to real time accurate information on money market transactions is critical to facilitating the price discovery process in the money market. Accordingly, the Central Integrated Market Monitor (CIMM) was introduced with effect from 01 March 2018 to report information on call money, foreign exchange and government security transactions. CIMM also requires LCBs and Primary Dealers (PDs) to report liquidity estimates with high level of accuracy before 08:30 hrs on each working day to estimate daily liquidity in the banking system.

6.2.1 Open Market Operations

(a) Liquidity forecast

DOD estimates overall liquidity in the domestic money market and liquidity distribution among market participants on a daily basis to facilitate the selection of the appropriate OMO action in consistent with the monetary policy stance. To estimate liquidity, the monetary policy actions and autonomous factors which include currency in circulation, foreign exchange transactions of the CBSL, changes in commercial bank reserve positions and transactions of the government with the CBSL are taken into consideration. Based on the estimated liquidity in the money market, along with other factors such as appropriate level of the operating target and liquidity distribution among market participants, DOD uses different types of OMO instruments to conduct monetary policy.

(b) Auctions

(i) Repo Auctions

In 2018, DOD conducted overnight, short term and long term repo auctions on need basis to absorb excess liquidity in the market. Accordingly, overnight repo auctions were conducted to absorb liquidity on overnight basis when the money market liquidity was in surplus. Short-term repo auctions were conducted as a strategy to absorb liquidity up to one week on the same day settlement basis. Long-term repo auctions were conducted with settlement of the next business day to absorb market liquidity for a period beyond seven days when excess liquidity was likely to persist for long periods of time.

Outright Purchase of Treasury bills (to inject liquidity)110475.0040.50

To offset the impact of increase in Treasury bill holding of the CBSL as a result of primary market purchase, outright sale of Treasury bill auctions were conducted quite aggressively in the first quarter of 2018. DOD conducted outright sale of Treasury bill amounting to Rs. 56.3 billion as against increase of holding by Rs. 60.0 billion in January 2018.

However, with the emergence of high liquidity deficit in the domestic money market since mid-September 2018, DOD resorted to outright purchase of Treasury bill auctions to inject liquidity on a permanent basis.

6.2.2. Standing Facility

Standing facilities were provided throughout the year at the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) to Participating Institutions (PIs) by bounding the overnight money market rates within the policy rate corridor. Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) was provided to absorb the excess liquidity from PIs while Standing Lending Facility (SLF) was provided to inject liquidity to PIs, when they

were unable to meet their overnight liquidity requirements fully through the inter-bank money market and OMO auctions. SDF transactions recorded a daily average of Rs. 18.8 billion in 2018, having recorded a total volume of Rs. 4,502.9 billion for the year 2018. The total volume lent under the SLF was Rs. 3,057.5 billion in 2018, with a daily average volume of Rs. 13.4 billion.

6.2.3 Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR)

The SRR determines the minimum amount of reserves that each commercial bank is required to hold in terms of the regulations of the CBSL, in the reserve account with the CBSL, in proportion to the total rupee deposit liabilities of the respective bank. DOD is responsible for both administering and the maintenance of statutory reserves as per the SRR and monitoring compliance by commercial banks in this regard. SRR applicable to rupee deposit liabilities of commercial banks was reduced by 150 basis points to 6.00 per cent from 7.50 per cent with effect from 16 November 2018.

6.2.4 Bank Rate

The Bank Rate is the rate of interest at which the CBSL provides short term advances to LCBs under Section 87 of the MLA. The Bank Rate remained unchanged at 15 per cent in 2018. However, the CBSL did not lend funds to any LCB at this rate during 2018.

6.3 Banker to Commercial Banks and the Government

6.3.1 Accounts of Financial Institutions

LCBs and PDs are connected to the monetary system through the settlement accounts with the CBSL. These accounts are maintained at DOD to facilitate clearance of payments and the settlement and for settlement of payments for scripless securities transactions among RTGS participants. Further, LCBs used these accounts for maintenance of bank reserves. Net settlement among LCBs in relation to payment and clearing systems such as Cheque Images and Truncation System (CITS), Sri Lanka Interbank Payment System (SLIPS), Common ATM Switch (CAS) and Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch (CEFTS) are done via RTGS and such net settlements are facilitated by DOD. By end 2018, DOD maintained accounts for 26 LCBs and 8 PDs, Employees Provident Fund and the Central Depository System.

6.3.2 Government Accounts

Performing the functions relating to the CBSL’s role as the banker to the government, DOD continued to maintain the accounts of government departments, agencies and statutory boards, and provided the required banking facilities to them. DOD maintained 64 such accounts as at end 2018 and handled 18,005 transactions amounting to Rs. 17,920.8 billion, during the year, on behalf of the government. More than 90 per cent of transactions were in relation to the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury (DST) Account, the Public Debt Department’s Current Account, the Inland Revenue Commissioner’s VAT Refund Account and the President’s Fund Account.

In terms of Section 89 of the MLA, the CBSL provides provisional advances to the government, free of charge, with a ceiling of 10 per cent of the estimated government revenue approved by the Parliament for a given fiscal year. At the beginning of 2018, provisional advance to the government was increased by Rs. 21.1 billion to Rs. 225.0 billion, based on the government’s revenue estimated for the year 2018 and approved by the Parliament, compared to that of Rs. 203.9 billion for the year 2017.

6.4 Provision of Intra-Day Liquidity Facility (ILF)

DOD continued its role towards the smooth and efficient operation of the RTGS system by making available intra-day funding through the intra-day liquidity facility (ILF) to RTGS participants. This facility was provided free of charge against the collateral of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds, which were valued at their current market prices with a sufficient hair cut to absorb any variations in market prices during the day.

The total value and average daily value of ILF drawn during the year amounted to Rs. 13,275 billion and Rs. 55 billion, respectively. This shows an increase in ILF utilisation over that of the previous year which amounted to a total of Rs. 11,430 billion with a daily average of Rs. 47.4 billion.

6.5 Supervision of Authorised Money Brokers

The Money Broking Regulations No. 1 of 2013 was issued under Section 10 (c) of the MLA and came into effect from 15 February 2013, considering the importance of Authorised Money Broking companies (AMBs) in the price discovery process in the money markets and to minimise the possibilities of market disturbances due to the involvement of AMBs. Subsequently, the Money Broking Regulations No. 1 of 2018 was issued with effect from 05 March 2018, repealing the Money Broking Regulations No. 1 of 2013 as amended by Money Broking Regulations No. 01 of 2016. Delegation of regulatory powers on forex market operations to the International Operations Department of the CBSL, introduction of new fit and proper rules for key officers and significant shareholders, inclusion of new sanctions for breaches of regulations and inclusion of reporting requirement of CIMM were included as major new additions.

With a view of further strengthening the market conduct and practices of the AMBs, CBSL took several measures recently to improve money broking industry. DOD introduced an online system to AMBs in 2016 to report details of transactions handled by them and it was further developed into a new system called the CIMM in 2017. At present PIs (LCBs and PDs) and AMBs report their transactions in the call, government securities and foreign exchange markets through the CIMM which came into operation in March 2018. Moreover, to upload financial statements and performance reports of AMBs, an online reporting system was introduced in 2018. CBSL issued a Code of Conduct for AMBs in November 2018 to ensure that operations of AMBs are carried out with high standards of integrity and professionalism in line with the international best practices.

By 2018, nine companies have been issued with “Certificate of Authorisation” under aforementioned regulations, which are designated as “Authorised Money Brokers”. During the year 2018, six meetings were held by the DOD with the Boards of Directors of these companies, while DOD conducted 9 on-site examinations.

7. ECONOMIC RESEARCH

The Economic Research Department (ERD), which is a member department of the Economic Policy Advisory Cluster, was established with the founding of the CBSL in 1950 under the MLA of 1949. As per Section 25 of the MLA, ERD is responsible for conducting economic research and compilation of information to guide the Monetary Board and the Governor in formulating, implementing and executing policies and providing information to the public in the areas of money and banking and other economic subjects of general interest. With the view of contributing towards maintaining economic and price stability, ERD carried out its major responsibilities by assessing macroeconomic developments on a regular basis and assisting in the formulation of monetary and external sector policies, among others, while improving the existing methodologies and formats in data collection and processing. Performing the CBSL’s role as the advisor on economic affairs to the government, ERD provided advice on emerging economic issues and recommendations on measures and policies that should be adopted to ensure greater fiscal-monetary coordination in order to achieve macroeconomic stability. While engaging in policy research, ERD published both statutory and other publications in order to keep the public informed of macroeconomic developments and operations of the CBSL. Moreover, ERD played an important role by establishing and maintaining relationships with foreign counterparts and other international agencies, and disseminating statistics and other macroeconomic information in a timely manner, thereby, improving cooperation and transparency.

7.1 Maintaining Economic and Price Stability

With the aim of achieving economic and price stability as per the mandate of the CBSL, ERD continued to compile, monitor and analyse data related to macroeconomic developments of the country to facilitate proactive and timely monetary policy decisions. Accordingly, as the secretariat of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), ERD produced and compiled

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 82

Part II

comprehensive reports inclusive of forward looking analyses containing economic and monetary statistics supported by model based macroeconomic projections to the MPC, thereby, enabling the MPC to make recommendations to the Monetary Board on required monetary policy decisions. Such inputs were further reinforced by the views and recommendations from the experts of the Monetary Policy Consultative Committee (MPCC), which was re-established in 2017 to enhance the dialogue between the CBSL and representatives of the academia and the private sector, in order to further strengthen the monetary policy decision making process and ERD facilitated the meetings of the MPCC. Moreover, ERD assisted the senior management by preparing the annual policy statement “Road Map 2019 - Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2019 and beyond” where the CBSL announced its approach in pursuing monetary policy and financial sector policies in the medium term, thereby, supporting the economy to reach its potential. ERD provided recommendations to the senior management on emerging issues and policy measures required for maintaining macroeconomic stability and the impact of fiscal measures already adopted by the government on various sectors of the economy. Further, ERD provided independent views on various issues of interest and highlighted their economic implications. ERD operated as the lead department on ‘Introduction of an Effective Flexible Inflation Targeting Regime’, which is one of the six bank-wide strategic priorities set for 2018-2020. The preparatory work continued on the adoption of Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) as the monetary policy framework including the initiation and the provision of required inputs to amend the MLA. In addition, ERD continued to improve its in-house modelling and forecasting capacity and infrastructure with the technical assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to develop a comprehensive, model-based Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS) to enhance the monetary policy decision making process.

7.2 Maintaining External Sector Stability

ERD carried out comprehensive analyses of the external sector by collecting, compiling and analysing statistics related to international trade and external finance, and provided policy advice and recommendations to the MPC and the Monetary Board, on a regular basis. As a part of this process, continuous assessment of the movements in exchange rates was conducted to identify any pressure on the rupee and prepare corrective measures in order to lessen any excessive volatility in the exchange rate.

Meanwhile, as per the provisions of the MLA, ERD continued to assess monetary implications of foreign loans obtained by the government during the year. Further, ERD liaised with the IMF and relevant departments of the Ministries and actively engaged in negotiations on the quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets and structural benchmarks outlined in the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme of SDR 1.1 billion (approximately US dollars 1.5 billion). Meanwhile, ERD submitted reports to the government analysing causes

and consequences of the developments in the external sector and the exchange rate and proposed policy measures to be adopted to address external sector vulnerabilities.

ERD undertook several initiatives to improve the compilation and dissemination of external sector statistics, in keeping with internationally accepted data reporting standards. ERD commenced publishing merchandise trade statistics compiled as per Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) Revision 04 on a monthly basis in 2018. ERD continued the publication of Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics and International Investment Position (IIP) statistics in the BPM6 format on a quarterly basis and International Reserve Data Template (RDT) on a monthly basis while making timely submissions related to Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) to the World Bank and direct investment data for the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) on an annual basis. Further, ERD conducted several surveys during the year to ensure accuracy and timeliness of external sector data.

(v) EPF Contribution through Electronic Media

The e-Return system which facilitates collection of EPF contributions and respective member details in electronic means was introduced by the EPF Department with an objective of improving its operational efficiency in a paperless operating environment. This system was operated on voluntary basis until the respective enactment, i.e., EPF (amendment) Act. No. 02 of 2012 came in to force. Accordingly, submission of EPF contribution details through an electronic media became mandatory for the employers having more than 50 employees in their employments. In 2011, LCBs joined this system as facilitators to collect EPF contributions via their own online portals which made a remarkable improvement in employer participation and speedy member accounts updating process while strengthening its administrative and monitoring functionalities. The e-Return system achieved its highest technological breakthrough in 2016 with the introduction of the online member information validating mechanism which brought 100% process automation and real time updation of member accounts. Accordingly, eight LCBs, including the two LCBs joined in 2018, are facilitating EPF online payments while four of them provide online member

information validation and real-time member accounts updating facility for their customers.

In addition, actions were taken to make the employers further aware regarding the e-Return submission procedure and its benefits for EPF stakeholders. Accordingly, participation of employers in e-Return submission system was increased from 7,900 to 8,540 covering approximately 81% of the active member accounts and nearly 88% of the total monthly EPF contribution by end 2018.

Further, with a view of introducing new methodologies for paying EPF, initiatives were taken to develop the EPF official website enabling employers to submit their e-Returns through the website and to implement the Lanka Clear’s Common Electronic Fund Transfer System which enables employers to pay monthly contributions from any participating bank.

(vi) Re-registration of EPF Members

The special project launched in 2010 by the Employee’s Provident Fund Department in collaboration with the Department of Labour (DL) to re-register its members with a view of providing an efficient service to both employers and employees was continued in year 2018. Accordingly, the collection of member information with National Identity Card (NIC) details and re-registration of such members as per the NIC data were carried out, facilitating the identification of the members with a Unique Identification (UID) Number and enabling both EPF and the DL to establish a common Member Centric Database (MCD). This programme helps both EPF and DL to provide the services to its stakeholders productively through the improved quality of member information.

By end of 2018, NIC details of around 1.91 million of active EPF members (contributing members) have been collected. Accordingly, 81 percent accounts of these members (1.55 million accounts) were assigned UIDs, while the verification of remaining members’ details is in progress. A system has also been established in parallel, to monitor the error-free updation of NIC details of all new members whose member contributions are received for the first-time, on a monthly basis. Further, necessary actions initiating to expedite the process and to re-register all active member accounts of EPF through an electronic validation system.

11. FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT

The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has been providing its services locally as well as internationally for over a decade now. Since its establishment in 2006 under the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006 (FTRA), it functions as an independent statutory authority. FIU acts as the lead Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulator of the country. In addition, FIU has provided a comprehensive coverage for country’s financial and non-financial establishments to comply with the AML/CFT regulations issued by Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and supervise by FATF jointly with Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG). The key functions of FIU include collection and receipt of information on financial transactions for the purpose of detecting possible links to Money Laundering (ML) and Terrorist Financing (TF) and other related unlawful activities as defined in the FTRA, analysis of suspicious financial transactions relating to the above unlawful activities and dissemination of information of such analyses to relevant law enforcement agencies for investigation. Furthermore, the functions of FIU are also enforced under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, No. 5 of 2006 (PMLA) and Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, No. 25 of 2005 (CSTFA).

11.1 Receipt, Analysis and Dissemination of Information

FIU has made it mandatory for reporting institutions to submit information on financial transactions, including suspicious transactions, from Reporting Institutions through a web-based system, “LankaFin”, especially designed to assist in reporting on ML and TF. Accordingly, Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), Licensed Specialised Banks (LSBs), Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs), Insurance Companies, Stock Brokers (SBs) and Money or Value Transfer Service (MVTS) providers continued to report to FIU on cash transactions and electronic fund transfers (both

local and foreign) of Rs. 1.0 million and above or its equivalent in foreign currencies.

Moreover, Authorised Money Changers (AMCs) also reported their cash transactions exceeding the threshold amount through the Director of Foreign Exchange who monitors and regulates the AMC sector. In 2018, FIU disseminated 317 STRs to law enforcement agencies and regulatory authorities for further investigation.

11.2 Regulation of Reporting Institutions

Accordingly, Gazette (Extraordinary) No. 2053/20 dated January 10, 2018 on Designated Non-Finance Business (Customer Due Diligence) Rules, No. 1 of 2018 was issued to Designated Non-Finance Businesses to conduct the customer due diligence based on “Risk-Based Approach”. Furthermore, during the year, FIU issued seven guidelines to Financial Institutions as well as Designated Non Finance Businesses and Professions on the areas such as Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risk Management, AML/CFT Compliance Obligations for Casinos and Gambling Houses, AML/CFT Compliance Obligations for Dealers in Real Estate, Precious Metals, Precious and Semi-Precious Stones, Identification of Beneficial Ownership, Implementing United Nations Resolution (Sanctions in relation to Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran) and Suspicious Transactions Reporting. Apart from this, a circular on Procedure of Conducting Risk-Based Onsite Examinations, was issued to strengthen the process of AML/CFT supervision.

11.3 Domestic and International Cooperation

During the year, FIU entered into a number of Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs) to share information among them and represented in several international cooperation events to enhance the knowledge of the FIU staff and knowledge sharing basis.

a) Memorandum of Understanding

In 2018, FIU signed three MOUs domestically with the Department of Motor Traffic, Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka and Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the total number of MOUs signed by FIU with domestic agencies increased to 08 as at end 2018.

b) Egmont Group

The FIU obtained assistance from members of the Egmont Group, the Association of the FIUs consisting of 155 member FIUs globally, in order to carry out investigations and collaborate with member countries to gather intelligence on their investigations. Total number of instances that FIU exchanged information with Egmont members was 94 in the year 2018. FIU responded for 24 requests from counterpart

(d) BIMSTEC Sub-Group on Anti Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (BIMSTEC SG-AML/CFT)

The FIU officers participated in the 10th SG-AML/CFT meeting of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) held in Kathmandu, Nepal during 19-20 November 2018.

11.4 Institutional Capacity Building and Awareness Programmes

In continued efforts to enhance the awareness on detecting, reporting and analysing of ML and TF related transactions, 61 awareness/training programmes were conducted during the year, accommodating 3,258 participants from LCBs, LSBs, LFCs, MVTS providers, DNFBPs, Stock Brokers and Insurance Comapines. The 4th and 5th Technical Assistance Mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was conducted by experts from the IMF during the period 26 February – 07 March 2018 and 26 November - 04 December 2018, respectively. The Mission continued to provide technical assistance to strengthen AML/CFT regime in Sri Lanka, in the areas of risk-based supervision, FIU capacity development and legislative amendments. Further, the Resident Advisor from the US Department of Treasury also continued to provide technical assistance in the areas of FIU Operational Effectiveness, Financial Sector Supervision and AML/CFT Case Development and Asset Management.

11.5 Review by International Cooperation Review Group

The 2nd Mutual Evaluation (ME) on Sri Lanka was conducted during 2014/15 by the APG, with the intention of assessing Sri Lanka’s AML/CFT compliance with international AML/CFT standards. The Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) adopted in July 2015 recommended a series of actions to be implemented by Sri Lanka under the APG’s ‘expedite enhanced follow up’ process. In October 2016, the FATF informed that Sri Lanka will be subjected to a review of the International Cooperation Review Group (ICRG) of the FATF to assess the progress of AML/CFT effectiveness. After several discussions and progress reports, the FATF informed that Sri Lanka has not made sufficient

progress in 4 areas, namely International Cooperation, Supervision, Legal Persons and Arrangements and Targeted Financial Sanctions on Proliferations (North Korea & Iran). As a result, the FATF at its Plenary held at Buenos Aires, Argentina in October 2017, listed Sri Lanka as a jurisdiction with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies in the FATF’s Compliance Document which is more commonly identified as the “Grey List”. Upon listing, a time-bound action plan to address the strategic deficiencies identified was provided to Sri Lanka.

Since the listing in November 2017, Sri Lankan authorities have taken effective and tangible steps to implement the FATF Action Plan including the passing of Trust Ordinance (Amendment) Act, No. 6 of 2018, Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Amendment) Act, No. 24 of 2018, issuance of regulation/ directives/guidelines on implementing United Nations Security Council Resolutions on Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran, extending the AML/CFT coverage to Designated Non Finance Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs) by issuing Customer Due Diligence Rules, implementation of risk -based supervision, enforcement actions and outreach for financial institutions and DNFBPs.

The FATF assessed Sri Lanka’s progress in implementing the Action Plan through the Asia Pacific Joint Group (AP/JG). Three progress reports were submitted and face-to-face discussions were held with the AP/JG on the progress made by Sri Lanka during January, May and September 2018, respectively. The AP/JG had acknowledged the progress made by Sri Lanka. Hence, it is expected that Sri Lanka would exit the “Grey List” by mid-2019.

Under the performance evaluation process, the level of performance of each employee is evaluated by assigning ratings for the performance achieved based on the generic and technical competencies as specified in the evaluation criteria. The final performance marks of employees are used as one of the requirements in the promotion criteria.

HRD carried out the employee performance evaluation process as planned during the year. Further, HRD reviewed the mid-year performance review process of the departments. It provided an opportunity to understand the level of performance of the staff members during the first half of the year to the relevant parties.

(c) Promotions

In line with the applicable promotion criteria, HRD made necessary arrangements to grant promotions for the employees ensuring their career progression, and thereby, a total of 216 staff members were granted their class and grade promotions in 2018. On this basis, 2 Assistant Governors were promoted as Deputy Governors Further, 44 Staff Class Grade III (1) officers were promoted

The LankaSettle System, which is the National Payments and Settlement System, was enhanced to comply with the best practices to maintain transparency in the government securities market for the protection of investors, by introducing an e-mail and SMS alert facility for securities movements settled in the System. In addition, the LankaSettle System was enhanced to capture the price and yield of primary and secondary market transactions of Government securities, to improve the price discovery mechanism.

Using an IT based solution, over one million National Identity Card numbers were updated in the EPF member register.

(b) Continuous enhancements of the ICT infrastructure

ITD continued to enhance the ICT infrastructure of the CBSL during the year 2018, in order to strengthen the resilience of information systems while keeping in par with the latest advancements in technology.

Firewalls function as a critical line of defense against cyber-attacks and insider threats. Firewalls in both the internal perimeter and the external perimeter of the corporate network were replaced with new state-of-the-art firewalls.

CBSLNet, which is the Virtual Private Network (VPN) that connects Participant Institutions to the CBSL Primary Site and Disaster Recovery (DR) Site to access business critical systems, was enhanced by implementing dual connectivity through two Telecommunication Service Providers to establish failover and high availability in the VPN. Further, to enhance the security of the network, end to end encryption was enforced over the VPN.

An SMS gateway, which allows the sending or receiving Short Message Service (SMS) transmissions to or from a telecommunications network, was implemented. It facilitates to send SMS alerts by the LankaSettle System to beneficial owners for securities movements that credits or debits their accounts. This SMS gateway will provide the facility for any other system that may need similar services in the future.

(c) Contribution to establish national payment system infrastructure

ITD continued to function as an advisor and a provider of technical expertise for projects of national interest. ITD Officials contributed their expertise to several national projects during the year.

An important national project set in motion is the establishment of an Electronic Trading Platform with a Central Counter Party System to strengthen the Financial Market Infrastructure. ITD officers served in the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) appointed for the selection of a suitable consultant for the project implementation.

In addition, ITD officials contributed to two committees appointed by the National Payment Council (NPC), the Committee on Fintech Developments and Committee on Blockchain Technology.

ITD officials provided technical expertise to the Payments and Settlements Department (PSD) to carry out onsite examinations on Dialog eZ cash and Mobitel mCash Systems. ITD officials also assisted the Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions to perform regulatory actions on some financial institutions.

(d) Strengthening IT security and resilience

ITD took several measures to enhance IT Security and protect the Bank’s IT assets from any cyber security threats. As a proactive approach, continuous vulnerability assessments were carried out on business-critical IT systems to identify vulnerabilities and necessary remediation actions were taken where necessary to mitigate them and reduce exposure to cyber-attacks.

ITD revised the CBSL’s Information Security Policy (ISP) and published the ISP Version 4.0 which specifies the baseline security standards and procedures for the information security of the CBSL.

Social Engineering tests were carried out to identify potential vulnerabilities in the human network. In this regard, spam emails were sent to targeted users to check on their awareness and subsequent advice was provided on best practices to stay safe.

ITD played a major role to obtain compliance to the SWIFT Customer Security Program (CSP) which was mandatory by end December 2018.

A training session on cyber security was conducted for Departmental IT Liaison Officers (DLOs).

(e) Upgrade ICT competencies among the staff

With an aim to enhance the IT knowledge of all employees in the CBSL, ITD continued to publish awareness banners on the intranet and circulate security advisory alerts through email. Training programs on Internet and Email Technology were conducted for CBSL Office Assistants.

Further, in order to uplift the knowledge and skills in the relevant fields, the staff of ITD attended short term training both locally and abroad.

15. INTERNAL AUDIT

The internal audit function has been in operation in the CBSL since 1951. The mission, scope of work, accountability, independence, responsibility and the authority of the Director and the staff of the Internal Audit Department (IAD) have been included in the Internal Audit Charter approved by the Monetary Board.

Part II - 100

Part II

15.1 Internal Audit Plan

The Internal Audit Plan prepared for the year 2019 was reviewed by the Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee (AAC) and approved by the Monetary Board.

15.2 Conduct of Audit Assignments

(a) Process and Information Systems Audits

In 2018, process and information systems audits were conducted as per the internal audit plan. Each audit engagement was carried out in four sequential steps, i.e., planning, performing, communicating audit results and taking resolution actions. The four step process, which was followed for the communication of audit results; conduct of closing conference with Auditee department to get audit observations validated, issuing of observation communication memo, issuing of draft audit report and issuing of final report, was changed into a three step process by eliminating the observation communication memo as recommended by the AAC and approved by the Monetary Board during the year. Implementation of audit recommendations by process owners was also followed-up during the year on a quarterly basis.

b) Conduct of Spot Audits

Spot audits were also conducted in 2018 as required and audit results were communicated to the process owners and other stakeholders.

c) Special Assignments

A spot check on files/documents related to investments in equities and government securities (2002 - end 2016) of EPF Department was carried out by IAD to facilitate forensic audits as per the instructions of the Monetary Board.

d) Reporting the Progress of the Conduct of Audits

Progress of the conduct of audit assignments was reported to the AAC and the Monetary Board, quarterly. Activity reports were submitted to the Auditor General on half-yearly basis.

15.3 Awareness Programmes and Provisioning of Training

IAD conducted a presentation for the Audit Coordinating Officers on the ‘Internal Audit Facilitation Guidelines’. Further, as per the request of the Human Resources Department, IAD continued to provide training on internal audit and related disciplines to undergraduates during the year.

15.4 Facilitation to the Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee

AAC is a sub-committee appointed by the Monetary Board which advises the Monetary Board on financial reporting, internal controls, risk management systems, compliance, whistleblowing, fraud, internal audit, external audit and any other matter assigned by the Monetory Board. Secretary to the Monetary Board is the Secretary to the AAC. Director of IAD functions as the Assistant Secretary to the AAC. Accordingly, IAD provided secretarial facilitation to the AAC during the year.

16. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

In terms of the Monetary Law Act (MLA), the CBSL is responsible for managing the official foreign exchange reserves of the country. In this regard, the International Operations Department (IOD) has been entrusted to perform the function of management of foreign exchange reserves and the monitoring of domestic foreign exchange market activities to ensure its smooth operation.

The MLA provides the necessary legal framework for international reserves management, covering areas on the maintenance and composition of international reserves, actions to preserve the international stability of the rupee, scope of foreign exchange operations of the CBSL and the powers and responsibilities of the Monetary Board pertaining to international reserves management activities. In this aspect, Section 67 of the MLA deals with the parameters in respect of asset types, counterparties, instruments and issuers. The Monetary Board may also direct to further widen the scope of reserves management activities to enhance the safety, liquidity and return objectives of reserves management.

16.1 International Reserves Management

Investments of international reserves are undertaken in accordance with the Foreign Reserves Management Guidelines as amended and approved by the Monetary Board, under the supervision of the Foreign Reserves Management Committee (FRMC) taking into consideration the safety, liquidity and return objectives. The international reserves are denominated in several key currencies and are mainly invested in Fixed Income Securities (FIS), Money Market Investments and Gold. The FIS portfolio consists of highly rated government securities, government guaranteed securities, securities of government agencies and supranational institutions. Transactions undertaken by IOD for reserve management purposes, are performed with central banks, highly rated commercial banks and investment houses, which are counterparties approved by FRMC as per the parameters stipulated in the Counterparty Credit Risk Management System (CCRMS) subject to the necessary limit allocations by the Risk Management Department, paying due consideration to the strength and creditworthiness of each counterparty.

Since 2016, CBSL is involved with the Reserve Advisory and Management Programme (RAMP) of the World Bank which provides advisory services and training to official sector investment managers enabling efficient management of foreign currency reserves and other investment portfolios. Accordingly, a new model based Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) was formulated based on the liability structure of the CBSL which mainly considered the objectives of capital preservation, liquidity requirements, income generation and the risk tolerance of the CBSL. As such, since 2016, the CBSL foreign reserves were objectively divided into three main tranches which comprise of different portfolios and are

Part II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 101

assigned with an investment horizon, currency composition and an asset composition. Each portfolio defined under those tranches are assigned with international benchmarks. Accordingly, the performance of the portfolios is reviewed against the respective benchmarks in order to be in line with the globally accepted best practices of performance reviewing.

Under the RAMP, the World Bank Treasury was also appointed as an external manager for CBSL reserve management by allocating US dollars 200 million out of the foreign reserves with a pre-defined mandate with an investment horizon of three years.

During 2018, two missions for technical assistance on foreign reserves management were facilitated as in-house trainings in CBSL with the assistance of World Bank technical experts. These missions focused on risk budgeting for foreign reserves and technical assistance on portfolio management and risk management.

16.2 Performance Analysis and Facilitation Activities

Under Performance Analysis and Facilitation, the following main functions relating to the CBSL’s reserves management are conducted.

(a) Performance Measurement

IOD daily assesses performance of its reserve management activities on a total return approach and presents monthly to the FRMC, and quarterly to the Monetary Board, together with an analysis of reserve position. The returns of FIS and MM investments are measured against respective benchmarks according to the SAA approved by the Monetary Board. Comparison against benchmarks helps to determine the effectiveness of the Active reserves management strategy by measuring the excess returns generated over the benchmarks. This approach is useful in identifing whether the return objective of management of reserves is achieved to a reasonable extent by investing within the approved guidelines. Performance attribution was introduced in 2018 to further elaborate total returns generated through foreign reserves management. This process helps to evaluate the performance of the portfolios by measuring returns generated by various sources of risk factors, and the resulting findings are used as value adding inputs in the CBSL’s foreign reserve management strategy.

(b) Administration of Treasury Management System (TMS)

IOD, the main user of the TMS, is responsible for the general administration function of the system and ensures a proper coordination among other user Departments, the software provider and its local partner. Accordingly, IOD ensures that the TMS is updated with relevant modifications/ patches and is fully connected with internal systems such as Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and General Ledger (GL) as well as external interfaces such as Bloomberg

and Reuters to ensure efficient functioning of TMS related procedures and processes.

(c) Monitoring of Non-Financial Risks

IOD identifies the non-financial risk profile relating to the reserves management activities and proposes relevant risk mitigation actions to the Non-Financial Risk Management Committee (NFRMC) on a quarterly basis.

(d) Annual review of existing counterparties for their adherence/compliance to Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT)

During 2018, IOD carried out its “Know Your Customer (KYC)/ Customer Due Diligence (CDD) rules for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for the foreign counterparties” to ensure compliance with rules and regulations and international best practices in relation to AML and CFT with regard to management of foreign reserves.

16.3 Domestic Foreign Exchange Market Developments

During the year, IOD made continuous efforts to ensure smooth operations in the domestic foreign exchange market, allowing more flexibility while curbing excess volatility in the exchange rate.

(a) Intervention to Domestic Foreign Exchange (FX) Market

The CBSL continued to intervene in the domestic FX market, as and when required during 2018 in order to curtail the excessive volatility of the exchange rate. In doing so, a new volatility based intervention framework executable through a transparent mechanism named “Request for Quote” (RFQ) was implemented by the CBSL from July 2018 onwards. This new mechanism enhanced market transparency as it necessitated LCBs to bid competitively by providing two-way quotes when the CBSL enters the market for foreign exchange interventions (on both selling and buying sides) to manage excess volatility in the exchange rate.

(b) New Monitoring System

As a step forward, in developing the domestic foreign exchange market, IOD introduced a new integrated market monitoring system named “Central Integrated Market Monitor” (CIMM) for real time reporting and monitoring of interbank FX transactions, at the beginning of the year. Further, in order to enhance the transparency and competition among LCBs, IOD commenced publishing the details of the last five outright trades, traded in the interbank SPOT market on real time basis on CIMM screen for LCBs and Authorised Money Brokers (AMBs) enabling them to trade in the foreign exchange market with a better knowledge of market movements.

(c) Dissemination of Information

IOD continued to publish USD/LKR indicative exchange rate along with indicative exchange rates for fifty six world currencies and average buying and selling exchange rates of nine major currencies against LKR provided by LCBs

Part II

for Telegraphic Transfers (TT) on the CBSL website on daily basis. In addition, IOD discharged its duties on the dissemination of information by providing exchange rate data to government organisations and various other parties, including the general public, at their request.

(d) Revision to Net Open Position (NOP)

With a view to support foreign exchange market developments, the NOP limits applicable to foreign exchange operations of the Licensed Banks (LBs) were revised in May and October 2018.

(e) Affiliation with Market Participants

IOD conducted several meetings with LCBs, AMBs, major importers and exporters in order to discuss their concerns with regard to the stress situation in the market and initiated several measures to overcome such issues with a view to streamline the FX market operations. Further, IOD continued to conduct Treasures’ meetings with LCBs on a quarterly basis to share information and to discuss issues relating to domestic foreign exchange operations. While doing so, IOD commenced supervision of LCBs and AMBs with regard to foreign exchange trading as and when required and took necessary actions in order to ensure market participants’ adherence to the global standards.

(f) Observation on Market Sentiments

Throughout the year 2018, as a key department responsible for monitoring the domestic FX market activities, IOD provided its views, observations and recommendations for various proposals, regulations, amendments and policy matters submitted by other departments of the CBSL and external organizations, with regard to the possible implications of such proposals on the exchange rate movements.

(g) Maintaining International Relations

IOD closely worked with the IMF staff missions that visited Sri Lanka to review the IMF – EFF and the South Asia Regional Training and Technical Assistance Center (SARTTAC) missions during the year and discharged the responsibility of regular data reporting requirements.

17. LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE

Legal and Compliance Department (LCD) has been established with a view to enhance the level of compliance of the CBSL with all legal and procedural aspects in achieving its core statutory objectives. Currently, LCD is entrusted to develop new laws to enhance the regulatory and supervisory authority of the CBSL, to amend the existing laws administered by it, to enhance such authority, governance and accountability standards in relation to all functions performed by the CBSL and to formulate an effective compliance framework, within which the management takes appropriate corrective action when potential compliance breaches are identified. In this respect, LCD undertakes wide range of activities of the CBSL and to ensure timeliness of the legal and regulatory framework on par with the international

standards and best practices. LCD is also required to contribute to achieve the strategic priorities of the CBSL. While being actively involved in all strategic priorities of the CBSL, LCD carried out following major activities during 2018.

During the year, LCD engaged in the introduction of legal reforms to the statutes administered by the CBSL. Amendments were proposed to the MLA, No. 58 of 1949 to facilitate a FIT monetary policy framework, enhanced governance standards and macroprudential authority of the CBSL. The Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance, No. 7 of 1937 was reviewed to enhance the accountability and transparency requirements in the issuance of Treasury Bonds. Amendments were proposed to the Banking Act, No. 30 of 1988 to enhance the regulatory supervisory framework. Further, LCD contributed to introduce the Active Liability Management Act, No. 8 of 2018 as a new legal framework to facilitate active management of public debt. In order for the financial sector regulators to pursue their respective statutory objectives for a stable and robust financial system and to contribute to the enhanced macroprudential surveillance in the financial sector, LCD engaged in drafting the Sharing of Information among Financial Sector Regulators Bill which was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and worked with the Legal Draftsman’s Department to facilitate enactment of the Bill. Actions have been initiated to introduce amendments to the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act, No. 2 of 1990 enabling all licensed banks under the Banking Act to receive benefit from the expeditious procedures provided therein to recover debts. All such activities were finally aimed at strengthening the financial system infrastructure.

When achieving its compliance objectives, LCD developed a Comprehensive Compliance Manual for the CBSL, which provided for a department-wise decentralised compliance framework to manage its legal, reputational and compliance risks. To strengthen the governance structures of the CBSL, a whistleblowing policy was introduced. Bridging a considerable gap in the governance framework, two codes of conduct were finalised for the members of the Monetary Board and the employees of the CBSL. Further, LCD took initiatives to assure that the CBSL has complied with the legal requirements provided for in the Right to Information Act, No. 12 of 2016 in association with the other departments.

LCD was responsible for handling litigation for which the Monetary Board, CBSL or its employees were parties, in consultation with the relevant authorities. In the year 2018, LCD initiated legal actions against certain financial institutions regulated by the CBSL and their directors. In relation to resolution measures initiated by the CBSL against some distressed financial institutions in 2018, LCD actively engaged with the supervisory departments in such deliberations and developed necessary legal instruments such as regulations, agreements, operational procedures etc., to effectively carry out such regulatory measures with a minimal legal risk.

Furthermore, in the pursuit of safeguarding the interests of the CBSL when dealing with internal and external parties, LCD engaged in vetting of agreements, to ensure that such instruments are in line with the legal requirements. LCD provided

Part II

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 103

legal advice on matters arising out of such agreements as and when necessary. In relation to the other operational activities of the CBSL, the opinion of LCD has always been sought by other departments of the CBSL to minimise the legal, compliance and operational risks in such activities.

In addition to above, during the year 2018, LCD represented several special committees established within the CBSL in respect of multiple subject matters pertaining to the activities of the CBSL.

During the year 2018, LCD as one of the key assurance functions, has successfully contributed to safeguard the legal interests of the CBSL and thereby to achieve its core objectives and strategic priorities.

18. MACROPRUDENTIAL SURVEILLANCE

Maintaining the financial system stability is one of the two statutory objectives of the CBSL. To achieve the financial system stability objective, the CBSL conducts microprudential supervision on a continuous basis. With the view of facilitating to achieve the same objective, the Macroprudential Surveillance Department (MSD) conducts a wide range of analysis on subsectors within the financial sector which complements microprudential supervision. In addition, MSD assesses the impact of broad macroeconomic factors on the domestic financial system and its stability. Financial sector surveillance is carried out using data reported by regulated financial institutes and the data collected through surveys conducted by MSD. The findings of such assessments contribute significantly to the financial sector policy making process of the CBSL. A summary of the main activities undertaken by MSD in 2018 is given below.

(a) Macroprudential Surveillance

MSD conducted macroprudential surveillance to identify systemic risks and/or buildup of systemic risks to the financial sector and to assess the ability of the financial system to withstand such risks. Said surveillance covered global and domestic macroeconomic developments, financial market activities and the risk exposures of financial institutions. MSD continued to compile a number of composite financial system stability indicators based on the stability and soundness of different sub sectors of the domestic financial system. In addition, the top-down macro stress testing for the banking sector was conducted to assess the impact of credit risk, interest rate risk, and foreign exchange risk on the level of capital of the banking system and also individual banks. Further, MSD continued to improve the stress testing model. Findings of these analyses were submitted to the Monetary Board in the quarterly Board Papers. In addition, MSD submitted a number of papers to the Monetary Board on contemporary concerns over Financial System Stability in 2018, including the impact of LTVs on vehicle imports, stickiness of Average Weighted Lending Rate (AWLR), high banking sector exposure on the construction sector and consumption loans and issues relating to the LFCs and SLC sector.

(b) Surveys and Data Collection

Systemic Risk Survey (SRS): MSD conducted the bi-annual Systemic Risk Survey which was initiated in 2017. The SRS is aimed at identifying market perceptions on the potential risks to the financial system stability. Findings of the survey was found important for policy making and regulatory purposes as it provides an opportunity to gauge confidence of stakeholders on financial system stability. Findings also provide policymakers a more futuristic view of emerging risks to the financial system and thereby help to prioritise risks to be dealt with. Systemic risks are found to be complex and measuring them with precision has been a challenging endeavor for MSD. However, the market perceptions gained through SRS provides reasonable insights to the stability of the financial system, and complements to macroprudential surveillance process.

Household Sector Creditworthiness Survey (HHCS): HHCS was initiated by MSD due to the increasing financial and social concerns on household sector indebtedness in Sri Lanka. The primary objective of HHCS is to establish a comprehensive data set on the household sector financial information that would enable assessment of debt servicing capacity of the households and its implications on the financial stability. In 2018, MSD collected required information on household sector and such information would be assessed to evaluate the magnitude and depth of the household sector dependence on formal and informal sources for their borrowings.

Data Collection: MSD continued to gather granular level data from several external parties to enrich its database. The Department continued to collect data regularly from external institutions such as the Colombo Stock Exchange, Department of Co-operative Development, Department of Labor, Department of Pensions, Employees’ Trust Fund Board, Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka, SANASA Federation, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka and the Unit Trust Association of Sri Lanka. In addition, MSD initiated to collect more granular level data from the Credit Information Bureau and Sri Lanka Customs to enrich its analysis.

(c) Publishing the FSSR and Contributing to Statutory Reports and Other Publications of the Central Bank

The Financial System Stability Review (FSSR) 2018: FSSR was published in December 2018. The purpose of this report is to disseminate a comprehensive risk assessment on financial institutions, markets and infrastructure. MSD will continuously endeavor to apprise the public on performance, associated risks, opportunities and regulatory developments of the nation’s financial system on an annual basis. The FSSR 2018 contained three chapters titled on International and Domestic Developments Affecting Financial Stability; Financial Sector Development and Stability and Special Notes on significant new developments.

Further, the Department contributed to the Chapter on Financial Sector Developments in the September 15th Report which is submitted to the Minister in charge of Finance. These reports provide comprehensive analyses on financial institutions, financial markets and financial infrastructure of the country with particular emphasis on performance, risks and risk management, resource availability and regulatory developments pertaining to each area, together with an assessment of potential implications on the overall financial system stability of the country. The Department also contributed to other publications of the CBSL by way of compiling financial sector data and providing analysis on subsectors of the financial system.

(d) Coordination of the Committees on Financial System Stability

Financial System Stability Committee (FSSC): MSD served as the secretariat for the FSSC in 2018. The FSSC was reconstituted in 2017 and the first meeting was held on 17 May 2018. FSSC is an inter-departmental forum which represents 14 departments of the CBSL and their respective Assistant Governors and Deputy Governors. FSSC is a forum for the identification of risks affecting the financial sector, discussion of measures to mitigate risks and the co-ordination of efforts to promote financial system stability. Three FSSC meetings were held during 2018.

Financial System Stability Consultative Committee (FSSCC): The FSSCC members appointed by the Governor consists of key personnel from external sector institutes prominent in the Sri Lankan financial system and the current FSSCC comprises of seventeen members. FSSCC provides views and advice to the CBSL on financial sector issues, and held four meetings during the year. MSD provides the secretarial services to FSSCC.

v. Formulating and implementing a comprehensive HR Strategy

vi. Implementing Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) framework and strengthening compliance.

With regard to the strategic priorities, time bound strategic actions were identified by the task forces appointed and strategic Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were identified by the relevant departments for each strategic priority. Lead departments were responsible for coordinating and implementing the strategic priorities whereas the PRMD closely monitored the progress of strategic priorities in collaboration with the lead departments.

20.2 Reviewing the Progress and Reporting to the Management

Progress of implementation of strategic priorities and Departmental Action Plans 2018 were reviewed at the quarterly review meetings during the year. An added feature to the monitoring mechanism was the introduction of classification status of KPIs: i.e. “fully completed”, “partly completed” or “not-commenced as expected”. This has given the opportunity to identify reasons that hindered the timely completion of KPIs by departments and also to make corrective actions. Subsequent to the progress review meetings, a comprehensive report was submitted to the CMC and to the Monetary Board. The level of achievement of strategic activities and operational activities of the CBSL at the end of 2018 stood at 90.57 percent and 93.42 percent, respectively, resulting in an overall achievement of 92.69 percent.

20.3 Strategic Planning Retreat 2018

PRMD conducted the thirteenth consecutive Strategic Planning Retreat on 20 - 21 October 2018 at the Atrium of the CBSL to discuss the strategic direction of the Bank, the overall progress of the first three-year strategic priorities and the Departmental Action Plans for the upcoming year with the participation of the Monetary Board and the Senior Management. Prior to the retreat, the PRMD conducted progress review meetings for Jan-Sep 2018 and the progress was presented at the retreat. Further, Departmental Action Plans 2019 were extensively discussed at the retreat and finalized, thereafter, incorporating the improvements proposed at the retreat.

21. PUBLIC DEBT

Public Debt Department (PDD) is responsible for discharging statutory responsibilities of the CBSL as the agent of the government for management of public debt in terms of Section 113 of the MLA. In order to meet these responsibilities, PDD was established on 28 August 1950, at the inception of the CBSL. The major functions of PDD include raising funds to meet the gross borrowing requirement of the Government as per the Appropriation Act, meeting the Government debt

service payments on time, maintaining the LankaSecure system in order to facilitate the smooth functioning of settlement of market transactions in Government securities and maintaining the title Registry of Government securities in the Central Depository System (CDS). In addition, the PDD also engages in developing the Government securities market, contributing towards in assessing debt management strategy and liability management initiatives.

21.1 Raising of funds to meet the Government gross borrowing requirement as specified in the Appropriation Act.

a) The issuance of Treasury bills (T-bills), Treasury bonds (T-bonds), Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) and International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) were the main debt instruments used for financing the government’s gross borrowing requirement in 2018.

b) An abridged table of activities under each of the source of funds is given below.

(c) Total net outflow of investments in T-bonds and T-bills by foreign investors in 2018 amounted to US dollars 990.7 million, which consisted of net outflow of US dollars 96.4 million in T-bills and US dollars 893.6 million in T-bonds.

d) In line with movements of primary market yield rates, a parallel upward shift was observed in the secondary market yield rates particularly during the latter part of 2018. Further, the upward shift in secondary market yield rates could be mainly attributed to the pressure arising from the withdrawal of foreign investments from emerging market economies including Sri Lanka mainly due to the normalisation of interest rates in the United States and the challenging domestic as well as global economic conditions that prevailed particularly towards the latter part of the year.

e) Average Time to Maturity (ATM) of the outstanding domestic debt stock increased to 5.91 years by end 2018 from 5.78 years by end 2017 due to the regular issuance of medium term T-bonds, emanated as a result of continuous engagement with market participants, advance issue calendar of T-bonds and aligning issuances with resource availability in the market.

21.2 Servicing of Government Debt

Domestic debt service payments of Rs. 1,515.7 billion and foreign debt service payments of Rs. 534.9 billion, totaling Rs. 2,050.6 billion was made during the year 2018.

21.3 Facilitation of the Settlement of Government Securities

The LankaSecure system is used for the settlement of primary and secondary market transactions in Government securities. The system consists of 34 Dealer Direct Participants (26 LCBs and 8 primary dealer companies) maintaining accounts on their own behalf and on behalf of other investors who will be their customers and 3 direct participants (Colombo Stock Exchange, Central Bank of Sri Lanka and EPF who hold accounts on their own behalf only. The PDD plays a main role in facilitating settlements by ensuring uninterrupted real-time operation of LankaSecure. The total face value of holdings in scripless securities as at end December 2018 amounted to Rs. 5,103 billion. This consisted of Rs. 758.8 billion in T-bills and Rs. 4,344.2 billion in T-bonds.

21.4 Maintenance of the Registry in Government Securities

Facility for real-time updates in the Title Registry of Government securities in the CDS, which is maintained at the PDD, has ensured the safekeeping of Government securities. Periodic statements to CDS account holders on their holdings, transactions and payments have been sent continuously throughout the year. PDD has sent 1,832 statements in electronic form and 16,026 semi-annual statements of holdings, 42,681 monthly statements of transactions and 18,744 payment statements by post to CDS account holders during 2018. In addition, CDS account holders are provided with the facility to view account details online. As at end December 2018, there were 94,082 registered CDS account holders.

21.5 System Reforms

In order to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness and transparency as well as to develop the Government securities market, the following system reforms were undertaken during 2018.

a) Enactment of the Active Liability Management Framework

The Parliament has approved the Active Liability Management Act (ALMA) in March 2018 and has passed the resolution to raise Rs. 310 billion by way of loans in or outside Sri Lanka. This will enable the government to proactively address part of the refinancing requirements ahead of time (reduce rollover peaks) and extend the maturity duration and / or smoothen repayments structure of ISBs and other debt maturities. In general, liability management will help the government to diversify the investor base, provide opportunities to streamline

the cost of borrowing based on market conditions, extend the duration of the liability portfolio, reduce refinancing risk in near term and create a favorable price tension for any new issuances. Further, the ALMA would enable the CBSL to initiate liability management exercises in the domestic and foreign market in the form of building buffers, switching, buy-backs, reverse auctions etc. The PDD in consultation with Ministry of Finance will initiate necessary actions to implement liability management on future debt obligations.

b) Institutionalisation of Medium Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS)

The Public debt management in Sri Lanka has become one of the key policy priorities in recent years primarily due to the rapidly increasing debt stock and the related debt service component in government expenditure. The MTDS will quantify the main risks of Sri Lanka’s public debt portfolio, specify an appropriate currency and maturity composition of debt issuance and a strategy to achieve it, present debt issuance options based on cost risk tradeoffs and be consistent with monetary and fiscal policy objectives. In line with that, PDD is closely coordinating with the Ministry of Finance in formulating MTDS for Sri Lanka and will be strategized and published by first quarter of 2019.

21.6 Way forward

a) The delivery of real-time notification to the customers of the LankaSecure System by way of an SMS or/and E-mail alert for each and every debit and credit record of scripless securities in the LankaSecure System, carried out for each Securities Account will be implemented in the first Quarter of 2019.

b) Explore the possibility of extending the new primary issuance system for T- bills and an electronic bidding arrangement for primary issuances of SLDBs to further improve transparency and efficiency of government borrowings from the domestic market. Further enhance the market based arrangements of the new primary issuance system for T-bonds and applicability in market participants in T-bond subscriptions.

c) Measures to strengthen the current legislations

Amendments have been proposed to improve the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance (RSSO) and Local Treasury Bills Ordinance (LTBO) to enhance transparency and to be on par with current market developments. Also, amendments have been suggested to Foreign Loans Act No. 29 of 1957 to be in line with international standards of accounting for external liabilities.

21.7 Coordinating Sovereign Rating Review Missions

In 2018, the PDD facilitated international rating agencies (Fitch Ratings Ltd., Moody’s Investor Services, Standard & Poor’s) for their annual rating reviews in order to ensure the availability of international sovereign ratings for Sri Lanka.

22. REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT

Regional Development Department (RDD), with the objective of supporting the achievement of inclusive and balanced economic growth, continued to coordinate, facilitate and implement various refinance, interest subsidy and credit guarantee schemes funded by the CBSL, the government, donor agencies and Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) while promoting financial inclusiveness in the country. Complementing these conventional credit operations, RDD continued to develop new strategies and initiatives started in the previous years and delivered a range of credit supplementary services in 2018.

During 2018, RDD continued to engage in improving access to finance of individuals and business ventures especially targeting the vulnerable groups in lagging regions. These initiatives were intended further to develop the capacities of potential entrepreneurs and their ability to meet the challenges that they have to face as entrepreneurs, while achieving a solid financial foundation and high self-reliance. In this effort, the micro, small and medium entrepreneurs of a wide spectrum of sectors including Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Industry and Services were catered by providing affordable credit facilities and credit supplementary services. In addition, RDD conducted a series of financial literacy, awareness building and skill development programmes island-wide during the year, mainly focusing on those who were outside the formal financial sector and underprivileged, with regard to the access to formal financial services, with the objective of building financially literate entrepreneurs.

In the policy front, RDD continued to take a number of proactive measures for the effective implementation of RDD operations in 2018, marking several important milestones. During 2018, the development of the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS), which was initiated in 2017, has witnessed positive developments ensuring its expected completion in 2019. The development of NFIS brings in the international exposure and experience in improving financial inclusiveness in the country. Further, six new refinance loan schemes were introduced under the Smallholder Agribusiness Partnerships Programmes (SAPP) funded jointly by the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) and the Government. The introduction of these six loan schemes marked a significant turning point in Sri Lankan concessionary lending tradition to the Agricultural Sector, as these schemes consist of the Public-Private-Producer-Partnerships (4Ps). The credit component of SAPP loan schemes were implemented by RDD with the support of the Project Management Unit (PMU) of SAPP operated under the Presidential Secretariat.

22.1 Providing Concessionary Financial Facilities

During 2018, RDD continued its credit operations by implementing eleven refinance, interest subsidy and credit guarantee schemes increasing the financial outreach. Information on refinance loan schemes and interest subsidy

schemes implemented by RDD, are given in Table II – 23. In financial terms, 105,867 number of beneficiaries accessed the formal financial sector through loan schemes implemented by RDD and obtained Rs. 16,431.7 million by means of concessionary loans granted through PFIs in 2018. The government funded loan schemes contributed 72.9 per cent to the total loans provided through loan schemes operated by RDD while the CBSL and IFAD contributed by 25.1 per cent and 2.0 per cent, respectively. Out of these funding, 71.5 per cent of loans were directed towards the Agriculture and Livestock Sector, while 14.2 per cent and 14.3 per cent were delivered to the Services Sector and the Industry Sector, respectively.

Status of the loan schemes implemented by RDD in 2018, is given below.

22.2. Implementation of the Government and PFI funded Schemes

Being the main source of the credit schemes implemented by RDD, the Government and PFI funded loan schemes contributed Rs. 11,986.7 million or 72.9 per cent to the total loan disbursements in 2018. These funds were directed to the beneficiaries through PFIs under 8 schemes which consist of 7 refinance loan schemes and an interest subsidy scheme. Among these schemes, “Sarusara” or the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) served as an interest subsidy scheme and a credit guarantee scheme. Under the NCRCS, the Government provided an interest subsidy for the loans granted by PFIs using their own funds.

(a) During 2018, the Government provided Rs. 245.6 million of interest subsidy on account of Rs. 9,021.7 million worth of concessionary loans granted by PFIs to 78,215 small-scale farmers of 33 short-term crop varieties. The lending by PFIs under the NCRCS increased by 15.0 per cent to Rs. 9,021.7 million in 2018 from Rs. 7,845.2 million in 2017 demonstrating the commitment of PFIs in lending to the agricultural sector. Accordingly, the interest subsidy provided by the Government also increased by 8.0 per cent in 2018 compared to that of Rs. 227.5 million in 2017.

Out of the total loans disbursed by PFIs under the NCRCS, the highest percentage of disbursements were recorded from the Ampara district, which accounted for 12.6 per cent (Rs. 1,137.9 million) of the total disbursements under the scheme. It was followed by the Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura districts which contributed Rs. 966.2 million (10.7 per cent) and Rs. 948.3 million (10.5 per cent), respectively, to the total disbursement of the NCRCS.

(b) The “Athwela” loan scheme which was introduced in August 2017 as a refinance scheme with government intervention to facilitate post-disaster economic activity recovery efforts, performed well in 2018. Of Rs. 1,500 million received from the Government, Rs. 1,499.7 million was disbursed to meet the refinance claim

made by PFIs against 3,543 loans disbursed by them. The “Athwela” loan scheme was implemented with the intention to provide concessionary financial facilities at 2 per cent per annum to the targeted beneficiaries in order to resume any economic activity affected by any disaster identified by the Government.

(c) In addition to the NCRCS and “Athwela” loan schemes, RDD implemented 4 other refinance loan schemes during 2018. These refinance schemes were the “Swashakthi” loan scheme, Poverty Alleviation Microfinance Project – Revolving Fund (PAMP-RF), Poverty Alleviation Microfinance Project II – Revolving Fund (PAMP II-RF) and Self-Employment Promotion Initiative Loan Scheme – Phase II (SEPI – II). In addition, RDD provided interest subsidy for the loans given under the Working Capital Loan Scheme for Tea Factories (WCLSTF) which was concluded in 2017. Out of these schemes, the PAMP-RF and PAMP II-RF refinance schemes collectively disbursed 7.1 per cent of the disbursements of the government funded loan schemes which amounted to a total of Rs. 855.9 million.

(d) Moreover, the PAMP II – RF was successfully completed on 15 July 2018 as scheduled, contributing to the poverty alleviation of the country, by granting loans amounting to Rs. 7 billion among 94,893 beneficiaries over its project duration.

(e) Continuing the past trend, a majority of the funds, i.e. Rs. 9,922.3 million or 82.8 per cent of the total funds provided by the government and PFIs were utilised to grant concessionary loans mainly to the Agriculture and Animal Husbandry sector. Individual and business ventures in the Services sector who required access to finance during 2018 obtained Rs. 1,366.6 million or 11.4 per cent of the government funded loan schemes implemented by RDD. Disbursements made to the Industry sector, which amounted to Rs. 697.7 million in 2018, accounted for 5.8 per cent of the total disbursements.

(f) More importantly, the Government entered into a Financing Agreement in early 2018 with the IFAD in relation to the implementation of SAPP and agreed to allocate US dollar 11.8 million for the implementation of the Revolving Fund (RF) Loan Schemes of SAPP as counterpart financing. RF Loan Schemes consist of three refinance schemes, namely, RF Capital Loan Scheme, RF Seasonal Loan Scheme and Income Generation Loan Scheme, which will be funded by the Government using the recoveries of the previous IFAD funded loan schemes. Detailed information in this regard is given in section 22.4 where the structure of the SAPP is discussed. Under the RF loan schemes, Seasonal, Capital/Working Capital and Income Generation loans are granted to the farmers or farmer/producer organizations engaged in 4P arrangements including women, youth, farmers, grass

root institutions, tea/rubber factories, tea/rubber nurseries and farm managers.

In 2018, 578 loans amounting to Rs. 112.7 million were registered under the RF Income Generation Loan Scheme of SAPP which is funded by the government. During the operational period of seven months ending December 2018, 527 loans amounting to Rs. 106.4 million were refinanced by the CBSL under the SAPP RF Loan Schemes.

22.3. Implementation of the Central Bank and PFIs funded Schemes

In 2018, Rs. 4,123.0 million or 25.1 per cent of loans were disbursed through the loan schemes funded by the CBSL and PFIs. The Central Bank funded refinance under the “Saubagya” Loan Scheme (SLS) and the interest subsidy under Commercial Scale Dairy Development Loan Scheme (CSDDLS).

(a) Disbursing Rs. 3,850.1 million or 93.4 per cent of the total funds disbursed through the CBSL and PFI funded refinance schemes, the SLS continued its position as the main refinance loan scheme implemented by RDD in 2018. During 2018, SLS served 5,445 number of beneficiaries, island wide.

(b) Moreover, SLS successfully achieved its Rs. 3,800 million refinancing target before the end of 2018. A majority of refinance, which is Rs. 465.0 million (12.1 per cent), has been disbursed among the beneficiaries in the Kalutara District. A closer look at the geographical distribution of the loan disbursements of SLS shows that the loan disbursements directed to Kurunegala District (Rs. 301.6 million or 7.8 per cent) and Kandy District (Rs. 294.9 million or 7.7 per cent) recorded the second and third highest performing districts, respectively. Majority of the disbursements of SLS, which accounted for Rs. 1,628.1 million or 42.3 per cent of the disbursements, was directed to the Industry sector while Rs. 1,234.6 million (32.1 per cent) was disbursed among the beneficiaries in the Agriculture and Animal Husbandry sector. The balance of Rs. 987.4 million (25.6 per cent) was provided to the services sector.

(c) The CSDDLS, the interest subsidy scheme funded by the CBSL, achieved its target of registering loans worth Rs. 6 billion expected over its project duration. During the first half of 2018, loans worth Rs. 272.9 million was disbursed through the CSDDLS among 287 beneficiaries. Under this scheme, loans are granted by PFIs using their own funds whilst interest subsidy is provided by the CBSL to PFIs. The scheme grants loans for the dairy farmers covering all aspects of activities related to dairy business in order to support the national objective of achieving self-sufficiency in milk.

(d) During 2018, a majority of the funds allocated by the CBSL for financing of SLS and CSDDLS were directed to the Industry sector. Funds disbursed through these schemes to the Industry sector amounted to Rs. 1,628.2

million, which accounted to 39.5 per cent of the CBSL funding. Of the total disbursements through RDD operated schemes, 36.6 per cent of the funding was granted to the Agriculture and Animal Husbandry sector (Rs. 1,507.5 million) which was followed by the 23.9 per of disbursements made to the Services sector (Rs. 987.4 million).

22.4. Implementation of Donor funded Schemes

During 2018, the IFAD extended both financial and strategic support to fulfill the regional development goals of RDD, as a long-term funding partner.

(a) SAPP was introduced with the closure of the major IFAD funded Agribusiness Development Loan Schemes operated under the National Agribusiness Development Programme (NADeP). NADeP consisted of NADeP Microfinance, Tharuna Diriya, Out Grower Farmers (Capital and Seasonal loan schemes) and Post-Disaster Economic Activity Recovery Loan (PEARL) schemes. The SAPP is jointly funded by IFAD and the Government by creating a consolidated Line of Credit incoporating the new financing provided by IFAD and the existing and future recoveries of the previous IFAD funded projects. Through the SAPP Financing Agreement, IFAD agreed to fund the SAPP by contributing US dollar 11.8 million to the programme. The Government agreed to contribute US dollar 18.5 million as counterpart financing utilising the recoveries of NADeP, the Smallholder Plantation Entreprenuership Development Programme and the Dry Zone Livelihood and Support Programme - Revolving Fund.

(b) In terms of the Financing Agreement, RDD has been identified as the agency for channeling loan proceeds from IFAD under the programme Revolving Fund. The Presidential Secretariat has been identified as the Lead Programme Agency (LPA) of the SAPP for the implementation of the activities related to increasing access to finance. The SAPP is coordinated by the Programme Management Unit (PMU), which operates under the Presidential Secretariat being the LPA.

(c) The main objective of the SAPP is to contribute to poverty reduction and increase competitiveness in the Sri Lankan smallholder community. It also intends to increase the income and quality of nutrition of 57,500 smallholder farmer households involved in commercially-oriented agriculture production and marketing system. SAPP consists of 6 loan schemes namely;

i. Public-Private-Producer-Partnership (4P) Loan Schemes; Capital Loan Scheme, Seasonal Loan Scheme, Youth Loan Scheme – Funded by IFAD

ii. Revolving Fund (RF) Loan Schemes ; RF Capital Loan, RF Seasonal Loan, Income Generation Loan Scheme – Funded by the Government Counterpart Financing

(d) The operation of the SAPP loan schemes, which were introduced in April 2018 are currently at the initial stage. As at end December 2018, 2,121 loans amounting

to Rs. 437.9 million were registered under the SAPP 4P Loan Schemes. During the operational period of 7 months that ended December 2018, 1,699 loans amounting to Rs. 322.0 million were refinanced by the CBSL under the SAPP 4P Loan Schemes.

(e) In the policy front, actions were taken to amend the Operating Instructions of SAPP loan schemes by increasing the maximum repayment period and the grace period of the loans granted under Seasonal Loan Schemes. It was mainly expected to address the practical difficulties faced by the farmers who carry out seasonal farming activities. Accordingly, actions were taken to increase the grace period of SAPP Seasonal Loan Schemes from 12 months to 18 months with regard to bullet/lump sum payments and to introduce monthly repayments up to a maximum repayment period of 30 months for the Seasonal Loans.

22.5. Strategic Initiatives of RDD

22.5.1.Developing a National Strategy for Financial Inclusion

RDD initiated actions to develop a National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) for Sri Lanka. In this regard, RDD has made arrangements to obtain technical and financial assistance of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group (WBG), to develop a comprehensive NFIS, which is aimed at promoting a more effective and efficient process to improve financial inclusion across the country. In this regard, the CBSL signed a Cooperation Agreement with the IFC in January 2018.

Through the proposed NFIS, it is expected to introduce a comprehensive strategy framework including an Action Plan assigning the responsibilities to stakeholders to increase the financial inclusion in the country. By implementing such a comprehensive framework, it is expected to provide each and every individual and business entity in the country, a fair and accessible financial system, which is inclusive and consists of adequate, quality, and affordable financial services. Moreover, the proposed NFIS which is expected to be implemented in 2019, will be accompanied with a National Level Financial Literacy Programme to cater to the need of improving financial literacy among all stakeholders in the economy including students who will be the future economic decision makers in the country.

Based on the knowledge exchange visit to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas by RDD Officers, to learn from the experience of developing a NFIS in the context of Philippines, it was proposed to take steps particularly to improve consumer empowerment via financial education. Moreover, an island-wide Financial Inclusion Survey was conducted in 2018 covering 480 Grama Niladari Divisions in all the districts through a dedicated survey firm selected for this purpose. It was mainly conducted to identify the state of financial inclusion in the country. Moreover, a group of WBG consultants visited the CBSL in

Part II

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 113

2018 and conducted a series of meetings and workshop with various stakeholders to gather their views, opinions and issues relating to financial inclusion in the country. Following these meetings, an outline for the NFIS was drafted and reviewed by the stakeholders. It is expected to have the second consultative workshop on NFIS with the participation of WBG consultants, during the first quarter of 2019.

22.5.2. Automation of the Operations of Loan Schemes implemented by RDD

During 2018, the RDD initiated preliminary actions to automate the registration and refinance of loans under the schemes operated by the RDD. This automation process, which is to commence from SAPP loan schemes, will be funded by IFAD under the Institutional Strengthening component of the SAPP Financing Agreement. The process is expected to be completed in collaboration with the PMU of SAPP, PFIs and the other relevant stakeholders.

The automation of the loan schemes of SAPP will enhance the smooth implementation of these schemes. This process will also pave the way to automate the operations of the entire loan portfolio of RDD, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations. The system will also act as a comprehensive Management Information System which will support the decision-making process of RDD more effectively.

In this regard, RDD conducted several meetings and workshops on user requirements and operational concerns, with the participation of relevant stakeholders. RDD expects to complete the project in 2019.

22.5.3. “One Village- One Product” Programme

With the intention of increasing the domestic agricultural production to ensure food and nutrition security of the country, the Central Bank initiated actions to promote “One village One-product” (OVOP) concept for commercial scale agriculture products by selecting potential villages. The broader objective of this programme is to support the sustainable development goals of the National Food Production Progarmme of the Government.

The OVOP programme can be set up as an integrated community development programme with a vision to increase income and wealth through adding value to local resources. Moreover, it is expected to lead to maximum utilization of resources available in designated villages through innovation, Research and Development (R&D), enhanced value addition of locally available resources, thereby developing products into locally, regionally and globally recognized products of unique quality benefitting the community by way of enhancement of income and improving standards of living.

22.6. Financial Literacy and Capacity Building

Identifying the importance of financial literacy and awareness as dynamic parts of the journey towards the comprehensive financial inclusion, RDD in 2018 conducted 163 awareness programmes compared to the target of conducting 150

programmes. The programmes were mainly focused on financial literacy, entrepreneurship development and skills development etc. to educate community leaders and other stakeholders who are involved in social mobilizing activities and financially excluded groups at the grass root level of society.

These programmes were intended to create awareness on the drawbacks such as household indebtedness caused by financial illiteracy. Further, these programmes highlighted the recompense of entering and linking with the formal financial sector. The focus groups were educated on good banking habits, financial discipline and new financial instruments and services as where they are financially literate, they have the ability to make informed financial choices regarding saving, investing, borrowing, etc. RDD reached both developed and lagging areas intending to create awareness on the drawbacks caused by financial exclusion. The target groups of these programmes consisted mainly of vulnerable groups identified by RDD based on its regional development experience over the period.

Details of the programmes conducted by RDD are given in Table II-24.

23. REGIONAL OFFICE MANAGEMENT

In terms of Section 7 of the MLA, “the Central Bank of Sri Lanka shall have its principal place of business in Colombo and may have such branches, agencies and correspondents in other places in Sri Lanka or abroad as may be necessary for the proper conduct of business of the Bank.” Accordingly, starting from 1981, the CBSL took steps to establish seven Regional Offices (ROO) in the districts of Matara, Anuradhapura, Matale, Jaffna, Trincomalee, Kilinochchi and Nuwara Eliya with the view of carrying out CBSL functions and promoting the development activities of respective regions. RO – Jaffna was amalgamated with RO – Kilinochchi in June 2017 in order to provide effective services to people in the region with the use of resources and facilities available at RO – Kilinochchi. Further, with the approval of the Monetary Board, from 2018, the districts of Rathnapura, Kegalle and Monaragala not covered by any ROO earlier were assigned under RO – Matara, RO – Matale and RO – Nuwara Eliya, respectively. Three districts in the Western Province, not covered by any ROO earlier came under Regional Office Management Department (ROMD) as well. Accordingly, functions of ROMD and ROO covered all 25 administrative districts in the country by 2018.

24. Resolution and Enforcement

Pursuant to the decision taken at the Monetary Board at its meeting No 21/2017 held on 16 June 2017, the Resolution and Enforcement Department (RED) was established with effect from 01 January 2018 by transforming the Enforcement Unit operated within the LCD. The Deposit Insurance Unit operated within the BSD and the Special Police Unit initially established under the LCD were also brought under the purview of the newly formed RED.

The main objectives of the RED are resolving distressed financial institutions, conducting special investigations against officials of institutions who have acted in contravention of provisions of relevant regulations in laws of Banking Act and Finance Business Act including prohibited schemes and unauthorized deposit taking entities etc. In order to achieve these objectives the Department consist of three divisions namely Resolution Division, Enforcement Division and Deposit Insurance Unit based on the core functions assigned to the department.

24.1.Resolution of Distressed Financial Institutions

Resolution and Enforcement Department is in the process of developing a comprehensive Resolution Framework for the Financial Institutions (FIs) licensed by the CBSL . It will be developed within the existing regulatory framework in which the resolution authority and its resolution powers are specified. At present almost all resolution powers are vested with the relevant regulators, i.e. Director of Bank Supervision Department in the case of licensed banks and Director Non-Bank Supervision Department in the case of Non-Bank FIs, as per the relevant legal enactments.

24.2. Enforcement Activities

Enforcement functions of RED are being conducted under operating procedures prepared including internal arrangements in terms of the prevailing legal provisions. Accordingly, for conducting of investigations on unauthorized finance businesses, Director of the Department of Non-Bank Financial Institutions authorizes officers of the RED under Section 42(1) of the Finance Business Act, No.42 of 2011 (FBA) and to conduct investigations on prohibited schemes, the Governor appoints officers of RED under Section 83C of the Banking Act, No.30 of 1988 (BA).

The officers of the RED initiated four investigations on the conduct of alleged prohibited schemes. Reports of two investigations along with the determination of the Monetary Board (MB) were submitted to the Attorney General Department for prosecutions. Further, officers of RED assisted CID and FCID for another two investigations on prohibited schemes and the completed investigation reports has been sent to the Attorney General Department for further proceedings.

RED concluded an investigation on an unauthorised deposit taking institution and initiated legal action as the directors of the company failed to comply with the determination and directions of the Monetary Board.

25. RISK MANAGEMENT

In pursuing CBSL’s policy objectives, it faces various risks, both financial and non-financial in nature. Since the materialisation of any of these risks could have a severe impact on the financial position and the reputation of the CBSL, a properly designed risk management framework is vital for CBSL. Recognising the strategic importance of an integrated approach to risk management in the CBSL, led to the creation of a separate Risk Management Department

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2018

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 116

Part II

(RMD) in 2015 to overcome the conventional management of viewing risk in silos. Accordingly, risk management was recognised as a key strategic priority of CBSL for 2018-2020 and the CBSL is in the process of implementing an Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) Framework for CBSL. This framework is intended to promote a culture of informed risk-taking at all levels of the CBSL .

The Risk Governance Framework which was approved by the Monetary Board in July 2018 comprises both a Risk Governance Structure and a Risk Management Structure and covers both, financial and non-financial risks confronted by the CBSL . The Risk Governance Structure consists of the Monetary Board (MB), and two board sub-committees, the Board Risk Oversight Committee (BROC) and the Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee (MBAAC). The MB holds the ultimate responsibility for the overall risk management function of the CBSL and sets the “Tone at the Top”. Further, MB is responsible for setting the risk appetite and risk tolerance level for CBSL and approving the risk management/compliance framework.

The BROC was set up in August 2018 and is chaired by Mr. Chrishantha Perera, independent member of the Monetary Board and comprises external experts (Mr. Ravi Abeysuriya, Director HNB Assurance from 01.08.2018 to 05.10.2018 and Mr. Priyan Fernando, Chairman Brandix and Senior Advisor, Boston Consulting Group from 05.10.2018 onwards). The BROC oversees CBSL’s overall risk management and compliance functions via a formal delegation from the MB, and is responsible for laying the broad strategy and policies for the Bank’s risk management and compliance functions. The BROC also assists the MB to ensure a dedicated focus on risk management and compliance at the CBSL .

The risk management structure that has been put in place follows the three lines of defence model. In the first line of defence, operational departments are expected to identify, assess, control, and mitigate risks and implement internal policies and procedures to ensure that activities carried out are consistent with the Bank’s goals and objectives. The Risk Management Department (RMD), as a part of the second line of defence shall facilitate the risk management process, by coordinating activities to direct and guide CBSL with regard to risk management.

RMD provides the foundation for designing, implementing, monitoring, reviewing the risk management function through risk management policies, guidelines and organisational arrangements and seeks to continuously improve the risk management process.

RMD also independently identifies, analyses, evaluates, treats, monitors, reviews and reports financial risks and ensures compliance with MB approved investment policies and guidelines. The third line of defence, Internal Audit provides assurance on the effectiveness of governance, risk

management, and internal controls, including the manner in which the first and second lines of defence achieve risk management and control objectives. Each of these three ‘lines’ play a distinct role within the Bank’s risk governance framework.

In addition to facilitating non-financial risk management of all the departments under the three lines of defence model, RMD is also responsible for the financial risk management of the fund management activities of the International Reserves (IR), and the Internal Investment Funds (IIF) of CBSL, as well as the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) which is carried out as an agency function for the Government. RMD revised the Investment Policy Statements (IPS) and Investment Guidelines (IG) for the EPF and IIF and set up Investment Oversight Committees (IOCs) to oversee these fund management activities. RMD also independently monitored market and credit risks pertaining to these fund management activities and reported risks emanating from them to the management. Market and credit risk indicators were presented at the monthly meetings of the Foreign Reserves Management Committee, where observations, from a risk perspective, on investment strategies and global market developments were conveyed to the Committee. Similar meetings were convened for the IOCs of the EPF and IIF on a quarterly basis, where risks and compliance issues pertaining to their investments were discussed.

In line with the new framework, RMD prepared a Risk Management Policy Statement (RMPS) for the CBSL, setting out the policies for implementation of risk management across CBSL. In this process, CBSL follows accepted standards and guidelines for managing risks, while assigning risk ownership and management among different stakeholders with clear accountability.

A survey was conducted amongst the Monetary Board and management of CBSL to determine the top bank-wide non-financial risks impacting the CBSL. The survey results would be used to develop a Risk Taxonomy for CBSL, which would help prioritise the bank-wide non-financial risk categories affecting CBSL and enable the management to concentrate on key risk categories that impact CBSL.

Recognising the importance of creating a risk culture within the CBSL , RMD conducted several risk awareness programmes for CBSL staff throughout the year at various fora, with the involvement of RMD staff and external resource personnel. Mr. Amedee Prouvost, Director, Operational Risk and Mr. Riaz Ahmed, Manager, Operational Risk at the World Bank, visited CBSL in October 2018 to share their experiences in dealing with operational risks and discuss a potential long-term technical assistance engagement with CBSL to strengthen the operational risk management function.

Going forward, RMD will continue to strive to create an environment where emerging risks that will have a material impact on the CBSL, and any risks taken beyond the risk appetite of the CBSL, are recognised, escalated and addressed in a timely manner. RMD will work with the operational departments to develop risk registers in a phased-out manner. Risk registers would enable the measurement of risk in a more consistent and uniform manner across all the operations in the bank. It would also provide risk information to the management to enable timely assessment and treatment of risks.

RMD is planning to implement an Incident Reporting Mechanism in early 2019, to facilitate reporting of risk incidents affecting the CBSL to the management and to ensure that appropriate actions are implemented to address the causes of such incidents. This on-line Incident Reporting System, would be accessible to staff at all levels. This would facilitate the development of a central repository of risk events within the CBSL to serve as a basis for analysing and assessing risk incidents, tracking progress on the implementation of corrective actions, identifying possible trends and areas of vulnerabilities and improving risk reduction measures, while strengthening the control environment and ensuring the formulation and implementation of appropriate responses to counter any negative impact on the CBSL. With respect to financial risk management, RMD’s focus would be on revisiting the credit risk policies and guidelines with a view to improving the credit risk management framework of the fund management activities of CBSL, covering CBSL’s counterparties, issuers and custodians.

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 119

population of this survey was large scale enterprises covering agriculture, industry and services activities of the economy.

The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) Survey for Manufacturing, Services and Construction activities were conducted on a monthly basis to be used as early indicators in GDP forecasting. Further, these indices are used by researchers, economic analysts, industry experts and business decision-makers to better understand the economic condition of the country. The target population for PMI Surveys for Manufacturing and Construction activities was purchasing managers, while that of PMI Survey for Services activities was designated officers with an overall knowledge of the business activities of the firms. The surveys for manufacturing and services sectors were carried out during the last week of each month targeting responses from 100 institutions for each sector, predominantly concentrated in the Western province. The survey for Construction industry was conducted on a monthly basis and it covered major construction companies selected from the companies registered with the Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA).

Credit Conditions Surveys, which were designed to capture the demand and supply side developments in the credit market, were also continued during the year 2018. With regard to the Credit Demand Survey, the target population was from the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) of the economy in the Western province and in the provinces where the CBSL has its regional presence. The Credit Supply Survey covered all LCBs and licensed specialised banks of the country. The results of Credit Conditions Surveys were reported to the management on a semi-annual basis to facilitate policy formulation.

(b) Inflation Expectations Survey

The Department continued to conduct the Inflation Expectations Survey on a monthly basis since its introduction in 2006. The current survey includes three main categories of respondents; Corporate Sector, Household Sector and the Academia. During the fourth quarter of 2018, Country Wide Data Collection System (CWDCS) Teacher Investigators (TIs) were also added to the respondent base, to improve the representativeness and precision of the household sector. Respondents provided both quantitative and qualitative information on current and future inflation expectations upto a period of 12 months ahead. The results of the survey were reported to the management on a monthly basis to be used for policy decision making.

(c) Labour Force Information and Public Sector Employment Survey

With regard to overall labour market data analysis, information obtained from the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) and other data providers, were analysed with respect to employment, unemployment, foreign employment, labour relations, labour market reforms and

labour productivity in the country. Collaborative data sharing was carried out with national and international agencies in order to assist the policy formulation process.

To ascertain the developments in the public sector employment, the Public Sector Employment Survey, covering all public sector institutions was carried out on an annual basis since 2018, which was previously conducted on a semi-annual basis. In addition, since 2018 the Department of Management Services (DMS) of the Ministry of Finance provides data pertaining to public sector employment. These data were analysed and published through the annual publications of the CBSL for the information of the general public.

(d) Private Sector Health Services Survey

This survey, which was designed to develop an indicator to capture the developments in private sector health services in GDP forecasting was conducted continuously during 2018 on a quarterly basis. The survey was conducted covering monthly data targeting a sample of hospitals registered under the Private Health Services Regulatory Council. Information on the number of out-patients and admissions was collected and used to capture the developments in the private health services. This was used as an indicator in forecasting the value-added growth of private sector health services.

(e) Super Market Retail Trade Survey

This survey, which was initiated in 2017 to capture trends in supermarket retail trade activities was continued on a quarterly basis in 2018. A quarterly supermarket cost of sales index was computed based on the data collected through this survey and was used as an indicator in STD’s indicator based GDP forecasting. Identifying the future potential of modern retail trade activities of the country, this indicator was also used as a proxy to analyse consumer spending patterns of the economy.

(f) Condominium Market Survey

This quarterly survey was initiated in 2017 with the objective of obtaining primary data on actual sales prices, the demand, reasons for price changes, number of existing and upcoming housing units, level of occupancy in projects, buyer portfolio information and forward-looking perceptions from condominium developers. The geographical coverage of the condominiums is limited to the areas of the projects carried out by the survey respondents. Information thus collected is used in identifying the price trends and other market developments, which provide insights for policy formulation purposes.

(g) ICT-BPM Survey

STD introduced a separate business conditions survey for the Information and Communication Technology and Business Process Management (ICT-BPM) sector from June 2018 with the support of the Sri Lanka Association of Software and Service Companies (SLASSCOM). The main advantages

of this survey are, using as a proxy indicator in the GDP forecasting process, sharing such information with the DCS to monitor/support the GDP estimation and sharing the data with business decision-makers and economic analysts to help better understand the industry conditions of the ICT-BPM sector.

(h) On Demand Surveys

Survey on Household Indebtedness in North Central Province

Identifying the trend in growing household sector loans and its likeliness towards serious ramifications on the business health of the financial sector, as well as on the household sector driving low-income families to a state of indebtedness, STD together with Macroprudential Surveillance Department, Regional Development Department and Regional Office Management Department launched a survey in the North Central Province (NCP) to further scrutinise the household sector indebtedness. The sample frame for the survey was the housing units in all Grama Niladhari divisions in NCP. A two-stage stratified sampling procedure was used to ensure the collection of unbiased information ensuring the reliability of the data. The survey was carried out using a structured questionnaire covering 1,500 households and the information was collected by interviewing the selected households by employing development officers of the area as enumerators for the data collection. The results were analysed by STD and reported to the management.

Global Digitalisation Survey

A global survey on “Digitalisation” was conducted by STD during 2018 together with 16 other Central Banks who were participants of the Annual Conference on Central Bank Business Surveys and Liaison Programme, organised by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta in Miami, Florida. The main objectives of conducting this survey were, to identify adoption of various forms of digital technologies by institutions and to gather information on their expectations regarding the impact of digitalisation on prices and employment. The survey for Sri Lanka was conducted by selecting institutions covering the three major sectors of the economy; agriculture, industry and services.

(i) Country Wide Data Collection System

The manual form of the CWDCS, which commenced in 1978, was revamped and a real time electronic data collection platform through tablet computers with a data collection Application (App) was initiated from 01 January 2018. The main objective of this process was to collect retail prices and producer prices on a timely basis to facilitate the forecasting of the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) for policy making purpose. Further, the new system would facilitate on demand surveys when required. To introduce the new e-data collection arrangement to the TIs network, STD conducted four seminars during the second half of 2018.

The regular collection of information on retail prices and producer prices of consumer goods, daily wages of the informal private sector and approximations on future production levels of agriculture and fisheries commodities on a weekly, monthly and quarterly basis were continued in 2018 with the support of the new e-data collection system. Those data were extensively used for analysing seasonal variations and regional differences in prices and wages; compilation of price indices, PGDP and SLPI; forecasting price movements and inflation; evaluation of the impact of policy changes on prices; estimation of national expenditure and income; and dissemination of price and wage data to the general public.

The CWDCS used the service of government school teachers for data collection covering the island. Further, the system utilised services of non-teacher data investigators to report data on wholesale and retail prices from the Pettah Market, Maradagahamula Rice Market, Dambulla and Narahenpita Special Economic Centers and Negombo and Peliyagoda Fish Markets on a daily/weekly basis. In order to strengthen the management information system, the Department collected the wholesale and retail prices of a range of food commodities directly from selected markets as well and published it on the CBSL website on a daily basis.

29.2 Compiling Indices

(a) Business Sentiment Indices

Based on the results of BOS, Business Sentiment Indices namely; Business Condition, Profitability, Skilled Labour Availability, Sales, Demand and Capacity Utilisation were compiled. The results were presented to the MPC and detailed reports were submitted to the management for policy making purposes. Further, major indices were published quarterly in aggregate form on the CBSL website for the information of external users.

PMI Manufacturing with the sub-indices of New Orders, Production, Employment, Suppliers’ Delivery Time and Stock of Purchases, and PMI Services with sub-indices of New Businesses, Business Activity, Employment, Backlogs of Work and Expectations for Activity were compiled assessing the month-on-month change. These results were reported to the MPC and senior management for policy decision making and issued press notices for the general public.

(b) Property Price Indices

STD compiled the Land Price Index (LPI) (base year: 1998) annually from 1998 to 2008 and bi-annually from 2009 to 2017, covering 50 centres of five Divisional Secretariats (DSs) in the Colombo District. With the increasing importance of monitoring land prices due to the recent developments in the real estate sector, STD expanded the geographical coverage of LPI to 82 centers covering all DS divisions in the Colombo District during 2018 and revised its base period to the first half of 2017. Value of a perch estimated by the Government Valuation Department for bare lands was used for the index

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 121

compilation process. In view of the diverse nature of land use and to maintain homogeneity, three sub-indices for residential, commercial and industrial lands were computed separately and the overall LPI was calculated by taking the average of the three sub-indices.

Compilation of the monthly index on condominium property prices developed based on sales prices available on property websites, was continued during 2018. Improvements to this process were introduced during the latter part of the year to enhance the efficiency of data collection and to expand the geographical coverage of the index. In addition, a new index was initiated in 2018 based on the transacted prices obtained through the Condominium Market Survey on a quarterly basis, which covers the projects owned by the survey respondents.

(c) Wage Indices

STD compiled wage rate indices to assess the movements of salaries and wages in the economy. In this regard, the wage movements of the public, formal private and informal private sectors were analysed separately. Nominal and real wage rate indices for the public sector were compiled based on the public administration salary circulars. For the formal private sector, real wage rate indices were compiled using the nominal wage rate indices provided by the Department of Labour for the employees in the Wages Boards Trades. STD also continued the compilation of the new index for the formal private sector, which was introduced in 2017, with improvements in the methodology. Informal private sector wage movements were analysed in terms of the informal private sector wage rate index compiled based on information collected through CWDCS.

29.3 Forecasting Key Macroeconomic Variables

STD forecasts short term consumer price inflation and economic growth using model based and indicator based techniques. These forecasts were analysed and discussed at the Staff Level Meetings, Pre-MPC, MPC and submitted to the Monetary Board to facilitate policy decision making.

The short term inflation forecasts were mainly based on recent price trends, econometric techniques and expected price movements associated with market developments. The Department continuously explored new variables that reflect both the supply and demand side impact on inflation to improve the inflation forecasting models. Moreover, the inflation forecasts were updated frequently in line with the realised and perceived changes in variables based on the developments in input and output prices reflected through findings of surveys conducted by the Department. In 2018, improvements to the NCPI forecasting methodology were introduced through the data collected via the CWDCS TIs. Further, model based inflation forecasts were improved through judgmental adjustment based on early warning system data.

Growth forecasts were prepared on a quarterly basis, using primary and secondary data related to each sub activity of the economy based on indicator as well as model based techniques. Leading economic indicators, survey findings and other information related to sub activities of the economy were combined with expert judgment for indicator based forecasts.

In addition, STD continuously contributed to the Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS) of the CBSL with required short term forecasts of inflation and GDP, relevant analysis and other information.

29.4 Compiling Regional Statistics

(a) Sri Lanka Prosperity Index

SLPI for 2017 was compiled to assess the overall status of prosperity in the country and in each of its provinces. This is a composite indicator which reflects the economic and social developments in the country and its provinces. SLPI comprises three sub-indices namely; Economic and Business Climate, Wellbeing of the People and Socio-Economic Infrastructure, which are measured using 43 representative variables.

(b) Provincial Gross Domestic Product

PGDP, in nominal terms for 2017, was estimated by STD by disaggregating the National Accounts estimates of the DCS, using relevant indicators at provincial level. These statistics reveal the provincial contribution to the national GDP and thus are useful to the provincial authorities as well as the national planners of the central government to introduce and implement appropriate strategies to lower income disparities among provinces.

29.5 Dissemination of Information

The Department continued its data disseminations in both printed and electronic means. Accordingly, its two main statistical publications namely; “Economic and Social Statistics of Sri Lanka 2018 – Volume XL” and “Sri Lanka Socio-Economic Data 2018 – Volume XLI”, were released in August and September, respectively, in all three languages. Further, Daily Price Reports of selected consumer items and Weekly and Monthly Economic Indicators were timely published in the CBSL website and the time series data spanning across Real, Monetary, Fiscal, External and Financial sectors, collected from nine internal Departments and several external institutions were included in the Data Library during 2018. The Department mainly contributed to two chapters of the CBSL Annual Report and Recent Economic Developments report and provided data to the Monthly Bulletin. In addition, the information was disseminated by way of press releases to the public at large and knowledge sharing exercises were also conducted throughout the year.
