This account was created under the guidance of the IMF by transferring the balance held in SCA-2 against Sri Lanka when it was decided to wind up SCA-2 by the IMF. The IMF requested the countries that had balances in the Post SCA-2 account to consider providing the balances in that account to the PRGF/HIPC Trust either as outright grant or as a means of providing a subsidy for PRGF/HIPC Loan. Accordingly GOSL agreed to transfer the funds from Post SCA \u20132 accounts to PRGF/HIPC Trust account, not as an outright grant, but as an interest free deposit until 2018. This was later extended until 2024.",

Since the materialization of any of these risks could have a severe impact on the financial position and the reputation of CBSL, a properly designed risk management framework is vital for CBSL. Recognizing the strategic importance of an integrated approach to risk management, led to the creation of a separate Risk Management Department (RMD) at CBSL in 2015 to overcome the conventional management of viewing risk in silos. Accordingly, risk management was recognized as a key strategic priority of the CBSL for 2018-2020 and the Bank is in the process of implementing an Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) Framework for CBSL. This framework is intended to promote a culture of informed risk-taking at all levels of the Bank.",

The MD measures the change in price of a security for a 1% change in the interest rates (yield). A higher MD indicates a higher risk.

This portfolio is not an investment portfolio, as the Bank does not purchase Treasury Bills with the intention of earning an interest income. The Bank purchases or sells Treasury Bills to inject rupee liquidity into the domestic market or to absorb liquidity from the market in the course of carrying out its monetary policy operations in relation to one of its core objectives, maintaining economic and price stability. Hence, the volume of Treasury Bills in the Bank\u2019s portfolio is determined by its monetary policy operations. In addition, the basic interest rates in the rupee market, the Repo rate and the Reverse Repo rate are policy rates determined by the Bank in the course of implementing its monetary policy. Moreover, the Bank\u2019s actions in injecting rupee liquidity or absorbing liquidity from the market have a significant impact on general rupee market interest rates. Thus, changes in the interest income earned from the Treasury Bill portfolio, which arise from changes in the volume of the Bank\u2019s Treasury Bill portfolio, as well as changes in interest rates, are primarily a consequence of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy actions, rather than due to investment decisions. Therefore, the Bank does not consider interest rate sensitivities arising from local currency assets.",

CBSL has signed an agreement which enable CH to lend at their wish depending on the demand for those bonds. Since the lending does not involve CBSL and CH lends them directly to the borrowers, the process is called auto bond lending. At the end of each month, custodian will send fee income for auto bond lending, if any for the bonds which they lent under auto bond lending programme.

Meanwhile, standing facilities were provided continuously to market participants to address liquidity needs on overnight basis. Accordingly, monetary policy operating procedure in 2018 continued to evolve in the midst of some changes in the nature and frequency of use of OMOs, policy rates, width of the corridor, the manner of policy signals, enhanced transparency, etc.",

ERD commenced publishing merchandise trade statistics compiled as per Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) Revision 04 on a monthly basis in 2018. ERD continued the publication of Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics and International Investment Position (IIP) statistics in the BPM6 format on a quarterly basis and International Reserve Data Template (RDT) on a monthly basis while making timely submissions related to Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) to the World Bank and direct investment data for the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) on an annual basis. Further, ERD conducted several surveys during the year to ensure accuracy and timeliness of external sector data. These surveys included the Annual International Investment Survey (AIIS), which was used to collect data on foreign assets and liabilities of the private sector and surveys related to trade in services covering resident and non-resident airlines, shipping lines, telecommunications, construction and insurance sectors. Further, ERD continued to conduct the monthly survey on inward workers\u2019 remittances with commercial banks during the year. Also, ERD laid the groundwork to introduce a new data collection system of International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS), to monitor both cross border and foreign currency transactions that take place through the banking sector.",

This system was operated on voluntary basis until the respective enactment, i.e., EPF (amendment) Act. No. 02 of 2012 came in to force. Accordingly, submission of EPF contribution details through an electronic media became mandatory for the employers having more than 50 employees in their employments. In 2011, LCBs joined this system as facilitators to collect EPF contributions via their own online portals which made a remarkable improvement in employer participation and speedy member accounts updating process while strengthening its administrative and monitoring functionalities. The e-Return system achieved its highest technological breakthrough in 2016 with the introduction of the online member information validating mechanism which brought 100% process automation and real time updation of member accounts. Accordingly, eight LCBs, including the two LCBs joined in 2018, are facilitating EPF online payments while four of them provide online member",

The returns of FIS and MM investments are measured against respective benchmarks according to the SAA approved by the Monetary Board. Comparison against benchmarks helps to determine the effectiveness of the Active reserves management strategy by measuring the excess returns generated over the benchmarks. This approach is useful in identifing whether the return objective of management of reserves is achieved to a reasonable extent by investing within the approved guidelines. Performance attribution was introduced in 2018 to further elaborate total returns generated through foreign reserves management. This process helps to evaluate the performance of the portfolios by measuring returns generated by various sources of risk factors, and the resulting findings are used as value adding inputs in the CBSL\u2019s foreign reserve management strategy.",

In addition, MSD assesses the impact of broad macroeconomic factors on the domestic financial system and its stability.

The findings of such assessments contribute significantly to the financial sector policy making process of the CBSL. A summary of the main activities undertaken by MSD in 2018 is given below.",

In addition, the top-down macro stress testing for the banking sector was conducted to assess the impact of credit risk, interest rate risk, and foreign exchange risk on the level of capital of the banking system and also individual banks. Further, MSD continued to improve the stress testing model. Findings of these analyses were submitted to the Monetary Board in the quarterly Board Papers. In addition, MSD submitted a number of papers to the Monetary Board on contemporary concerns over Financial System Stability in 2018, including the impact of LTVs on vehicle imports, stickiness of Average Weighted Lending Rate (AWLR), high banking sector exposure on the construction sector and consumption loans and issues relating to the LFCs and SLC sector.",
