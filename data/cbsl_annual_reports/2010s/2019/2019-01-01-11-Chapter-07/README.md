7.1 OverviewW

ith the objective of maintaining a tight

monetary policy stance being realised,

the Central Bank signalled an end

to the monetary tightening cycle in April 2018,

and adjusted to a neutral monetary policy stance

during the remainder of the year. Accordingly,

in consideration of the favourable developments

in inflation, inflation outlook as well as the subpar

performance in the real economy, the Central Bank

reduced the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR)

by 25 basis points to 8.50 per cent in April 2018.

In view of the developments in the global economy

amidst the continued monetary policy normalisation

in the United States and its impact on the stability

of the external sector of the economy, the Central

Bank maintained a neutral monetary policy stance

thereafter. Meanwhile, the large and persistent

liquidity deficit in the domestic money market,

particularly since September 2018, compelled the

Central Bank to inject liquidity on a permanent basis

by way of reducing the Statutory Reserve Ratio

(SRR) applicable on all rupee deposit liabilities of

commercial banks by 1.50 percentage points in

mid November 2018. Nevertheless, to neutralise

the impact of the SRR reduction and maintain its

neutral policy stance, the Central Bank increased

the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) by

75 basis points and the SLFR by 50 basis points,

further narrowing the policy rate corridor. Despite

the liquidity injection in November 2018, liquidity

deficit in the domestic money market continued to

persist at high levels. Accordingly, the Central Bank

reduced the SRR by a further 1.00 percentage point

to 5.00 per cent with effect from 01 March 2019,

while maintaining the SDFR and SLFR unchanged

at 8.00 per cent and 9.00 per cent, respectively.

In response to developments in the domestic

money market and Open Market Operations

(OMOs) of the Central Bank, the Average Weighted

Call Money Rate (AWCMR) remained mostly in the

middle of the policy rate corridor during the first half

of 2018, but AWCMR moved to the upper bound of

the policy rate corridor at times when credit to private

sector accelerated and external sector pressures

emerged. Yields in the government securities market,

which showed mixed movements during the first

nine months of 2018, witnessed a notable increase

during the last quarter of 2018, reflecting changes in

market sentiment due to political uncertainty as well

as tight domestic liquidity and heightened domestic

borrowings. Other market interest rates remained

high in both nominal and real terms. Although credit

granted to the private sector by commercial banks

moderated during the first eight months of 2018,

the overall expansion in credit to the private sector

was more than expected in 2018, in spite of tight

market liquidity conditions and high interest rates.

The government also relied more on domestic bank

sources of financing, while increased borrowing by

state-owned business enterprises also contributed

to domestic credit expansion. However, driven by

the contraction in net foreign assets of the banking

sector, the year-on-year growth of broad money

(M2b) decelerated to 13.0 per cent by end 2018.

Despite this, with nominal economic growth of 7.7

per cent, the available money supply did not restrict

economic activity.

In spite of the sharp depreciation of the

rupee against major currencies and transitory

price pressures due to upward revisions to

domestic prices of petroleum products and other

administratively determined prices, headline and

core inflation remained subdued in 2018 as a result

of well anchored inflation expectations under the

enhanced monetary policy framework. Projections

indicate that inflation is likely to remain within the

desired 4-6 per cent range in 2019 and beyond,

supported by the envisaged move to flexible

inflation targeting (FIT) by the year 2020.

7.2 Monetary Policy Stance of the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka

With the aim of maintaining inflation at

low and stable levels, thereby supporting

sustainable economic growth, the Central Bank

continued to conduct monetary policy within

an enhanced monetary policy framework, in an

increasingly forward-looking and data driven

manner, which was in line with its move towards

flexible inflation targeting (FIT). Under this setup,

the average weighted call money rate (AWCMR)

serves as the operating target, while broad money

(M2b) remains a key indicative intermediate variable

to guide the conduct of monetary policy with the

aim of maintaining economic and price stability.

During the year, significant progress was made

towards the transition to FIT. The monetary policy

formulation process has been upgraded since 2017

with the introduction of different levels of technical

meetings. The Central Bank continued to improve

its in-house modelling and forecasting capacity

and infrastructure with technical assistance from

the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to develop

a comprehensive, model-based Forecasting and

Policy Analysis System (FPAS) to enhance the

monetary policy decision making process. The

number of Monetary Policy Committee meetings

per year has been limited to eight allowing sufficient

space for deeper macroeconomic analysis.

Meanwhile, notable progress was made in terms of

initiating necessary amendments to the Monetary

Law Act (MLA) with a view to improving governance

of the Central Bank, strengthening its independence

and facilitating the adoption of FIT as the monetary

policy framework to ensure sustained price stability.

Financial sector oversight is also to be strengthened

under the proposed macroprudential policy

framework. Accordingly, approval of the Cabinet of

Ministers was obtained in principle for the concept

paper on proposed MLA amendments during 2018.

Sri Lanka received technical assistance from the

IMF on required amendments to the existing MLA,

and subsequently, in March 2019, the Cabinet of

Ministers granted approval to draft legislation to

repeal and replace the MLA to facilitate FIT, along

with other amendments.

In spite of the sharp depreciation of the

rupee against major currencies, consumer price

inflation remained low in 2018 albeit with short

term fluctuations arising from volatile food

prices and administratively determined price

adjustments. Headline inflation, as measured by

the year-on-year change in the Colombo Consumer

Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100), was broadly

on a downward path in 2018, despite a peak

recorded in August 2018. The surge in headline

inflation during mid-2018 was explained by cost

push factors arising from upward adjustments in

domestic petroleum prices and volatile food prices.

However, inflation decelerated significantly during

the latter part of the year and reached levels even

lower than the desired mid-single digit levels. This

was primarily due to downward adjustments to fuel

prices and selected administratively determined

prices, lower food prices with the recovery of the

agriculture sector as well as the reduction of the

Special Commodity Levy and Telecommunication

Levy on some selected imported items. The impact

of the sharp depreciation of the rupee on inflation

was limited during the period under review mainly

due to well anchored inflation expectations, prices

of a number of key imported items being determined

administratively, improved domestic food supplies,

as well as the diminishing role of the exchange rate

as a nominal anchor under the enhanced monetary

policy framework. Accordingly, year-on-year

headline inflation based on the CCPI declined to

2.8 per cent by end 2018 from 7.1 per cent at end

2017. Headline inflation as measured by the year-

on-year change in the National Consumer Price

Index (NCPI, 2013=100) followed the same trend

as the CCPI with a peak in July 2018 and continued

to remain in low single digit levels thereafter. Year-

on-year headline inflation based on the NCPI

declined sharply to 0.4 per cent by December

2018, compared to 7.3 per cent recorded in

December 2017. On an annual average basis, the

CCPI based headline inflation decelerated to 4.3

per cent by end 2018 from 6.6 per cent recorded

at end 2017, while the NCPI based annual average

inflation decelerated to 2.1 per cent by end 2018

from 7.7 per cent at end 2017. Headline inflation as

measured by the year-on-year change in both the

CCPI and the NCPI showed some acceleration in

the first quarter of 2019 mainly due to higher non-

food inflation driven by increased expenditure on

certain items such as house rentals and education.

Accordingly, the year-on-year headline inflation as

measured by the CCPI increased to reach 3.7 per

cent in January 2019 and 4.0 per cent in February

2019, while the NCPI based headline inflation rose

to 1.2 per cent in January 2019 and 2.4 per cent in

February 2019. As per the Inflation Expectations

Survey of the Central Bank, expectations of the

corporate sector remained relatively high in the

middle of 2018, but declined thereafter, partly in

line with the decline in the actual headline inflation.

Inflation expectations of the household sector

showed highly volatile behaviour during 2018

mainly due to the depreciation of the Sri Lankan

rupee against the US dollar. Meanwhile, during

2018, inflation remained within the inner band

stipulated under the IMF-Extended Fund Facility

(EFF) Programme except during the last quarter

of the year where average inflation was below the

inner band.

Core inflation, which is a stronger measure

of demand driven underlying inflation than

headline inflation, remained at low single digit

levels throughout 2018, reflecting the impact

of the relatively tight monetary policy stance

maintained during the past years and anchored

inflation expectations. Year-on-year core inflation

based on CCPI decelerated to 3.1 per cent by end

2018 compared to 4.3 per cent recorded at end

2017, reflecting subdued demand pressures in the

economy. NCPI based year-on-year core inflation

was 3.1 per cent by end 2018 in comparison to 2.7

per cent at end 2017. On an annual average basis,

CCPI based core inflation decelerated to 3.5 per

cent by end 2018, compared to the 5.9 per cent

recorded in 2017, while NCPI based core inflation

decelerated to 2.4 per cent by end 2018 from

4.9 per cent at end 2017. In January 2019, price

increases in the non-food category, particularly

price adjustments in the housing and education

sectors, contributed to an increase in underlying

inflation, resulting in CCPI based year-on-year

core inflation increasing to 5.5 per cent in January

2019, but decelerating marginally to 5.4 per cent

in February 2019. Meanwhile, NCPI based year-

on-year core inflation also picked up in the first two

months of 2019, recording 5.5 per cent, in February

2019.

The year 2018 posed a challenge to monetary

policymakers as several upside and downside

risks on the domestic front had to be balanced

against a rapidly evolving global environment.

The tight monetary policy stance followed by the

Central Bank, since end 2015, yielded the expected

outcomes, particularly in terms of managing demand

driven inflation and containing money and credit

growth from the peak levels observed in 2016 and

2017. Such developments together with a favourable

inflation outlook, amidst subdued performance

in the real economy prompted the Central Bank

to signal the end of its monetary tightening cycle.

Accordingly, in April 2018, the Central Bank reduced

the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) by 25

basis points to 8.50 per cent, while the Standing

Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) was kept unchanged at

7.25 per cent, thereby narrowing the policy interest

rate corridor. As adverse developments in global

economic conditions, amidst capital outflows with

US monetary policy normalisation created pressure

on the external sector of the economy and raised

volatility in the domestic markets, the Central Bank

followed a neutral monetary policy stance thereafter.

Considering the large and persistent deficit liquidity

conditions in the domestic money market since

September 2018, the Central Bank reduced the

Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) applicable on all

rupee deposit liabilities of commercial banks by 1.50

percentage points, effective mid November 2018.

This measure injected around Rs. 90 billion liquidity

to the banking sector on a permanent basis. At the

same time, the Central Bank increased the SDFR

by 75 basis points to 8.00 per cent and the SLFR

by 50 basis points to 9.00 per cent to neutralise the

market impact of the SRR reduction and thereby

maintain its neutral monetary policy stance. The

upward adjustment in policy rates and reduction of

SRR are also expected to help narrow the spread

between deposit and lending rates in the market.

Meanwhile, as the high and persistent liquidity deficit

conditions in the domestic money market continued,

the Central Bank reduced the SRR by a further

1.00 percentage point to 5.00 per cent, effective 01

March 2019, while signalling the maintenance of the

neutral monetary policy stance.

The Central Bank conducted active Open

Market Operations (OMO), responding to

varying market conditions, in order to guide the

overnight interest rate in line with the monetary

policy stance. During the first five months of 2018,

surplus liquidity in the domestic money market was

mopped up by conducting overnight, short term, as

well as long term repurchase transactions by the

Central Bank, with the aim of maintaining the Average

Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR) around the

middle of the policy rate corridor. As rupee liquidity

turned into a large and persistent deficit and the

AWCMR moved toward the upper bound of the policy

rate corridor, the Central Bank continued to supply

liquidity to the market since September 2018 by way

of conducting overnight, short term and long-term

reverse repurchase transactions as well as outright

purchases of government securities. Meanwhile,

with a view to strengthening the signalling effect

of OMOs, access of nonbank primary dealers to

OMO auctions was withdrawn with effect from 25

September 2018.

Continuing the deceleration trend

observed in 2017, the growth of broad money

supply further decelerated in 2018 yielding

envisaged outcomes of the tight monetary

policy stance adopted by the Central Bank

since end 2015, although the growth of credit

to the private sector expanded more than

expected particularly in the fourth quarter of

the year. Contributing to the moderation in broad

money (M2b) growth, Net Foreign Assets (NFA)

of the banking sector contracted considerably,

particularly since August 2018, on account of the

increase in Central Bank foreign currency liabilities

to international agencies and the intervention in the

domestic foreign exchange market in the wake of

capital outflows, as well as the increase in foreign

currency liabilities of commercial banks. The year-

on-year growth of credit disbursed to the private

sector continued to moderate during the first eight

months of 2018, although credit growth picked up

towards the latter part of 2018. Net credit to the

government and credit to State Owned Business

Enterprises (SOBEs) also expanded notably in

2018 contributing to the monetary expansion.

The Central Bank and the government

implemented several additional measures

during the year to curtail credit expansion,

particularly in relation to imports. Accordingly, a

100 per cent minimum cash margin requirement,

which was later raised to 200 per cent was imposed

against Letters of Credit (LCs) for the importation

of motor vehicles with effect from October 2018.

Further, a 100 per cent cash margin was imposed

on the invoiced value of imports of non-essential

commodities against LCs and under documents

against acceptance (DA) terms in October 2018.

Meanwhile, opening of LCs for the importation

of vehicles under the scheme for the issuance

of motor vehicle permits on concessionary terms

to state sector employees was suspended in

September 2018. At the same time, loan to value

ratios for credit facilities granted in respect of motor

vehicles were also tightened in October 2018.

However, margin requirements against LCs for the

importation of vehicles and non-essential goods

were withdrawn effective 07 March 2019 following

the upward tax adjustments on vehicle imports

through the government budget 2019.

The Central Bank pursued several strategies

to enhance its monetary policy communication

to manage inflation expectations and

communicate policy rationale with the overall

aim of achieving its monetary policy objectives

effectively. With a view to providing proper insights

on monetary policy decisions to the general public

and stakeholders, the analytical value and the

forward looking content of the monetary policy press

releases were further improved. The Central Bank

also conducted programmes to educate journalists

and other stakeholders on the move towards FIT. In

addition, the Central Bank continued to publish its

key publications including the Annual Report and the

Recent Economic Developments Report to provide

a comprehensive set of macroeconomic statistics

and relevant analysis for the public. While improving

the content and the format of key publications, the

Central Bank website was revamped to enhance

its user-friendly accessibility with more features,

and macroeconomic statistics presented on a daily,

weekly, monthly and quarterly basis on the website

in all three languages. On a regular basis, the Central

Bank communicated its policies and decisions via

press releases, information notes, publications,

bulletins, press conferences, meetings, seminars,

lectures and speeches by the Governor and other

key officials of the Central Bank, thus helping to build

awareness amongst the general public and other

key stakeholders and anchor their expectations in

line with the envisaged low inflation trajectory.

7.3 Movements of Interest Rates

Market Liquidity and Short Term Interest Rates

Rupee liquidity in the domestic money

market, which was in surplus during the first

five months of 2018, turned to be persistently

negative towards the fourth quarter of 2018.

During the first five months of the year, market

liquidity remained in surplus, averaging around

Rs. 20 billion, largely supported by purchases

of foreign exchange from the domestic foreign

exchange market and purchases of Treasury bills

by the Central Bank. The Central Bank conducted

overnight, short and long-term repurchase auctions

during this period to mop-up excess liquidity from

the market with a view to maintaining AWCMR at

desired levels. However, as a result of the early

retirement of Treasury bills held by the Central

Bank, the unwinding of short term swaps to improve

the quality of international reserves and the foreign

exchange sales of the Central Bank to prevent

excess volatility in the exchange rate, domestic

money market liquidity turned into a deficit during

the period from June to mid July 2018. However,

with foreign exchange forward transactions carried

out by the government with the Central Bank,

liquidity in the domestic money market improved

to a temporary surplus during the period from

mid-July to September 2018. Since then, liquidity

returned to a deficit mainly due to the reversal of

the forward transactions with the government,

foreign exchange sales by the Central Bank and

maturing of Treasury bills held by the Central Bank.

Thereafter, there was a persistent and expanding

deficit in liquidity in the domestic money market

mainly due to the impact of foreign exchange sales

by the Central Bank. To address the persistent

liquidity deficit in the domestic money market, the

Central Bank reduced the SRR applicable on all

rupee deposit liabilities of commercial banks by

1.50 percentage points to 6.00 per cent, from 7.50

per cent, with effect from mid-November 2018.

Although this policy intervention injected around

Rs. 90 billion to the market on a permanent basis,

liquidity in the money market continued to remain

in deficit partly due to foreign exchange sales

by the Central Bank. Imposition of the margin

requirement on LCs on the importation of motor

vehicles and the requirement that such deposits be

maintained with the Central Bank also contributed

to the liquidity deficit to some extent. Accordingly,

from mid-September to end 2018, daily overnight

liquidity deficit amounted to Rs. 57.4 billion on

average, while the overnight liquidity deficit stood

at Rs. 148.4 billion by end 2018. Consequently, the

Central Bank conducted overnight, short term, long

term reverse repurchase auctions and purchased

Treasury bills on an outright basis to provide

required liquidity to the domestic money market,

thereby maintaining stability in short term interest

rates. The Central Bank further reduced the SRR

by 1.00 percentage point to 5.00 per cent effective

01 March 2019 as deficit liquidity conditions in the

domestic money market persisted in the first two

months of 2019.

MONETARY POLICY, INTEREST RATES, MONEY AND CREDIT

Overnight interest rates showed some mixed

movements during 2018 reflecting the changes

in market liquidity conditions and the monetary

policy signals of the Central Bank. During the first

three months of 2018, the AWCMR continued to

remain mostly around the middle of the policy rate

corridor, responding to surplus rupee liquidity levels

in the domestic money market. Meanwhile, with the

removal of withholding tax on the interest income

on Treasury bills and Treasury bonds effective

from 01 April 2018, a transitory increase in the

AWCMR was observed towards end March 2018

due to a misinterpretation of the effect of withholding

tax adjustments by commercial banks. However,

with the reduction in SLFR in early April 2018, the

AWCMR declined and remained around the middle

of the policy rate corridor up to end May 2018. As

liquidity conditions in the domestic money market

turned to a deficit by mid-2018, the AWCMR adjusted

upwards and hovered around the upper bound of the

policy rate corridor. Although the AWCMR adjusted

downwards towards the middle of the policy rate

corridor during August to mid-September 2018 with

surplus liquidity conditions, the AWCMR returned

to the upper bound of the policy rate corridor

thereafter. With the large liquidity deficit persistent in

the money market and the increase in policy interest

rates in mid-November 2018, the AWCMR moved

closer to the upper bound of the policy rate corridor

through appropriate OMOs. By end 2018, the

AWCMR was 8.95 per cent compared to 8.15 per

cent at end 2017. Moreover, the weighted average

yields at the daily OMO auctions and Sri Lanka Inter

Bank Offered Rates (SLIBOR) also moved in line

with the movements in the AWCMR during 2018.

Accordingly, weighted average yields at daily OMO

reverse repurchase auctions increased to 8.98 per

cent by end 2018 from 8.49 per cent by end June

2018. Overnight and 12-month SLIBOR were at 9.00

per cent and 11.80 per cent, respectively, by end

2018, compared to 8.15 per cent and 12.18 per cent,

respectively, at end 2017. Further, with a view to

strengthening the signaling effect of OMOs, thereby

effectively managing the AWCMR, the access given

to non-bank primary dealers to participate in OMO

auctions was withdrawn by the Central Bank with

effect from 25 September 2018.

Yields on Government Securities

Yields on government securities, which

showed mixed movements during the first nine

months of 2018, increased notably during the

last quarter of 2018, reflecting changes in market

sentiment as well as the funding requirement of

the government amidst tight liquidity conditions.

Yields on Treasury bills in the primary market showed

an upward movement during the first quarter of

2018 due to the increased funding requirement of

the government along with the delay in securing

foreign financing by the government. Although some

stabilisation in yields was observed since then with

the receipt of US dollars 2.5 billion on account of the

International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) issued in April

2018, upward pressure on yields of government

securities was observed by May 2018, partly due

to outflows of foreign investments in government

securities, in view of tightening global financial

conditions. The upward pressure on yields eased

somewhat in July-August 2018, before re-emerging

from September 2018, due to unfavourable market

sentiments amidst capital outflows and tight liquidity

conditions. Domestic political uncertainty caused

yields in Treasury bills to remain elevated in the

latter part of 2018. Reflecting these developments,

during 2018, yields of 91-day, 182-day and 364-day

Treasury bills increased by 232, 169 and 230 basis

points to 10.01 per cent, 9.99 per cent, and 11.20

per cent, respectively, in comparison to yields that

prevailed at end 2017. Since mid January 2019,

yields on Treasury bills in the primary market eased

gradually.

Yields on Treasury bonds in the primary

market also displayed mixed movements

during 2018. Following a trend similar to Treasury

bills, yields on Treasury bonds in the primary

market increased during the first quarter of

2018, in view of the high borrowing requirement

of the government. However, mixed movements

in the yields on Treasury bonds were observed

thereafter, in line with market sentiments and

the movement in market liquidity conditions.

Yields on Treasury bonds displayed an overall

increase by end 2018 as the domestic financing

requirement increased notably with the delay

in foreign financing amidst domestic political

uncertainty. The government relied more on short

to medium-term Treasury bond issuances during

2018, while Treasury bonds with longer maturities

of 10 and 15 years were also issued occasionally.

However, 2 year Treasury bonds were not issued

in 2018 to address possible bunching issues.

The government issued short and medium-term

US dollar denominated Sri Lanka Development

Bonds (SLDBs) at various fixed and floating rates,

particularly during the first nine months of the

year. Further, ISBs with maturities of 5 and 10

years were issued in April 2018 with a coupon of

5.75 per cent and 6.75 per cent, respectively, and

marked Sri Lanka’s twelfth US dollar benchmark

offering in the international bond markets. In the

meantime, ISBs with maturities of 5 and 10 years

were also issued in March 2019 with a coupon of

6.85 per cent and 7.85 per cent, respectively.

The secondary market yield curve for

government securities shifted upwards in 2018

in comparison to levels seen at end 2017 amidst

tight liquidity conditions. Yields on 91-day, 182-

day and 364-day Treasury bills in the secondary

market increased by 199 basis points, 167 basis

points and 202 basis points, respectively, to 9.67

per cent, 9.96 per cent and 10.91 per cent by

end 2018, from levels that prevailed at end 2017.

Treasury bond yields also increased within a range

of 148 to 179 basis points by end 2018, compared

to the levels observed at end 2017. However, some

downward shift in the secondary market yield curve

was observed in early 2019 as a result of improved

sentiments and in response to the Central Bank’s

action to ease the liquidity shortage in the domestic

market, along with the issuance of ISBs in March

2019.

Deposit and Lending Interest Rates

Amidst tight liquidity conditions and the tight

monetary policy stance that was maintained

until April 2018, most deposit interest rates

of commercial banks remained at high levels

during 2018. Overall, the Average Weighted Deposit

Rate (AWDR), which captures the movements in

interest rates of all outstanding interest bearing

rupee deposits held with commercial banks,

decreased by 26 basis points to 8.81 per cent by

end 2018 from 9.07 per cent recorded at end 2017.

Following a similar trend, the Average Weighted

Fixed Deposit Rate (AWFDR), which is based on

interest rates of all outstanding time deposits held

with commercial banks, also decreased by 63

basis points to 10.85 per cent by end 2018 from

11.48 per cent at end 2017. Meanwhile, with a view

to removing the impact of interest rates subsidised

by the government on market interest rates, the

AWDR and AWFDR were calculated by replacing

senior citizens’ special deposit rate of 15.0 per

cent with relevant market interest rates since July

2018. Reflecting the commercial banks’ attempt to

mobilise deposits in an environment of tight liquidity

conditions, the Average Weighted New Deposit

Rate (AWNDR), which captures the interest rates

offered on all new interest bearing rupee deposits

during a month, increased by 88 basis points to

10.94 per cent by end 2018 from 10.06 per cent

at end 2017. Further, the Average Weighted New

Fixed Deposit Rate (AWNFDR), which is based

on interest rates offered on all new time deposits

during a month, increased by 62 basis points to

11.27 per cent by end 2018 from 10.65 per cent

recorded at end 2017. Depositors continued to

benefit from positive real rates of return during

2018 with inflation remaining considerably lower in

comparison to deposit rates.

Tight liquidity conditions amidst continued

high demand for credit caused lending rates of

commercial banks to remain high in 2018. The

weekly Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate

(AWPR), which is computed based on interest rates

applicable on short term loans and advances granted

by commercial banks to their prime customers

during a week, increased by 54 basis points to

12.09 per cent during 2018. The monthly average

of weekly AWPR increased by 61 basis points to

11.94 per cent during the period under review. The

Average Weighted Lending Rate (AWLR), which is

based on interest rates of all outstanding loans and

advances extended by commercial banks, increased

by 52 basis points to 14.40 per cent during 2018.

Meanwhile, bank-wise average weighted lending

rates were in the range of 10.96-17.25 per cent at

end 2018 compared to the range of 10.22-16.23 per

cent observed at end 2017. Lending rates against

most types of securities also increased during 2018.

In particular, interest rates on loans and advances

secured by motor vehicles, including tractors and

leasing and hire purchase agreements, increased

considerably during the year. Furthermore, the

Average Weighted New Lending Rate (AWNLR),

which captures interest rates of all new loans

and advances extended by commercial banks

during a month, increased by 13 basis points

to 14.44 per cent during 2018. Also, with the

low inflation environment, real lending rates

remained elevated during 2018. In addition, the

spread between deposit and lending rates were

also high.

The Legal rate and the Market rate of

interest,1 as determined by the Monetary Board

and published in the Government Gazette at the

end of each year, were 11.50 per cent per annum

for 2019, compared to 9.08 per cent per annum

for 2018. The Legal rate and the Market rate for

2019 were computed based on simple averages of

monthly AWDR and AWLR of commercial banks,

which prevailed during the twelve months ending

October 2018.2

1 The Legal rate is defined under the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 6 of

1990 and is applicable to any action for the recovery of a sum of money. The Market rate is defined under the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 2 of 1990 and applies only in relation to actions instituted by lending institutions for the recovery of debt exceeding Rs. 150,000 arising out of commercial transactions, where there is no agreed rate of interest.

2 In 2018, the calculation method of the Legal Rate and Market Rate was revised. Accordingly, the rates for 2019 were calculated based on simple averages of monthly AWLR and AWDR, which prevailed during the twelve months ending October 2018.

Interest Rates on Debt Instruments

Interest rates on corporate debt instruments

remained high, although some moderation

was observed during 2018. Interest rates on

commercial paper decreased to a range of 13.10-

15.00 per cent by end 2018, compared to the

range of 13.75-16.50 per cent recorded at end

2017. During 2018, reflecting banks’ efforts to

meet enhanced capital requirements as stipulated

by the minimum capital requirement under the

implementation of the Basel III framework, there

were 21 listings of corporate debentures by 11

corporates with maturities of 3-10 years, compared

to 13 listings reported in 2017. These debentures

were issued at various fixed and floating interest

rates. Fixed interest rates offered on these issues

were in the range of 12.00-14.75 per cent by end

2018 compared to the range of 12.50-15.00 per

cent at end 2017.

Interest Rates on Foreign Currency Deposits

Despite the gradual tightening of global

financial conditions led by interest rate hikes

in the USA, interest rates applicable on foreign

currency deposits maintained with commercial

banks showed mixed movements during 2018.

The US Federal Reserve raised its Federal Funds

target rate four times during the year by a total

of 100 basis points to 2.25–2.50 per cent by end

2018. Bank of England also raised their bank rate

by 25 basis points to 0.75 per cent during 2018,

while the European Central Bank ended its asset

purchasing programme by end 2018. Reflecting

such developments, interest rates pertaining to US

dollar denominated time deposits increased to a

range of 0.25-6.00 per cent by end 2018, compared

to the range of 0.15-5.03 per cent recorded at

end 2017. However, interest rates on US dollar

MONETARY POLICY, INTEREST RATES, MONEY AND CREDIT

denominated savings deposits remained in a range

of 0.02-4.12 per cent at end 2018, compared to the

range of 0.02-4.38 per cent at end 2017. Interest

rates applicable on pound sterling denominated

time deposits were in the range of 0.10-3.50 per

cent at end 2018, whereas the comparable rates

were 0.20-4.57 per cent at end 2017. Meanwhile,

interest rates on savings deposits denominated in

pound sterling were in the range of 0.10-2.48 per

cent at end 2018, in comparison to the range of

0.10-2.25 per cent recorded at end 2017.

7.4 Movements of Monetary and

Credit Aggregates

Reserve Money

Reserve money recorded a moderate growth

during 2018, particularly in the latter part of

the year with the downward adjustment in SRR

in November 2018. Accordingly, year-on-year

reserve money growth decelerated to 2.3 per cent

by end 2018 from 9.8 per cent recorded at end

2017. In absolute terms, reserve money increased

only by Rs. 21.3 billion to Rs. 961.1 billion during

2018, compared to an expansion of Rs. 83.6 billion

recorded in 2017. Based on the liability side of

reserve money, the expansion during 2018 was

entirely due to the increase in currency in circulation,

while commercial banks’ deposits with the Central

Bank declined during 2018 as SRR was reduced

in November 2018. Reflecting the continued high

opportunity cost of holding currency with prevailing

high interest rates, the year-on-year growth of

currency in circulation moderated further to 7.2

per cent by end 2018 from 8.2 per cent recorded

at end 2017. The overall increase in currency in

circulation in 2018 amounted to Rs. 42.9 billion, in

comparison to the expansion of Rs. 45.3 billion in

the previous year. Meanwhile, commercial banks’

deposits with the Central Bank, which recorded a

cumulative increase of Rs. 43.1 billion during the

first ten months of 2018, subsequently contracted

by Rs. 64.7 billion in the months of November and

December 2018, with the reduction in SRR to 6.00

per cent from 7.50 per cent effective mid November

2018. Meanwhile, the imposition of the margin

requirement on LCs and imports on DA terms in

October 2018 as a measure to curtail selected

imports, with a requirement to maintain the margin

deposits with the Central Bank, limited the impact of

the SRR reduction on commercial banks’ deposits

with the Central Bank. Overall, commercial banks’

deposits with the Central Bank declined by Rs. 21.6

billion in 2018 compared to an increase of Rs. 38.5

billion in 2017. Accordingly, commercial banks’

deposits with the Central Bank declined by 6.3 per

cent, year-on-year, by end 2018, in comparison to

the growth of 12.7 per cent observed at end 2017.

As per the assets side of reserve money,

the growth of reserve money was entirely

due to the expansion in Net Domestic Assets

(NDA) of the Central Bank. NDA of the Central

Bank increased by Rs. 116.9 billion in 2018,

in comparison to a sharp decline of Rs. 203.9

billion in the previous year. The expansion in

NDA of the Central Bank was the result of a

significant expansion in credit extended to the

government on a net basis (NCG) by the Central

Bank, reflecting an increase in the Treasury

bill holdings of the Central Bank. Treasury bill

holdings of the Central Bank (net of repurchase

transactions), which contracted significantly

by Rs. 304.5 billion to Rs. 25.6 billion by end

2017, increased notably by Rs. 247.4 billion to

Rs. 273.0 billion by end 2018 mainly due to term

and outright purchases of government securities

by the Central Bank from the market in order to

inject liquidity to the domestic money market.

Provisional advances to the government,

however, recorded a marginal decline of Rs. 1.2

billion by end 2018, and the outstanding amount

of provisional advances to the government

from the Central Bank was Rs. 198.6 billion.

Consequently, during the year, NCG by the

Central Bank increased by Rs. 246.3 billion

in contrast to a decline of Rs. 187.9 billion in

2017. Moreover, the significant decline in other

assets of the Central Bank on a net basis was

mainly a result of notable international reserve

revaluation, amidst the sharp depreciation of

the rupee. Meanwhile, NFA of the Central Bank

contracted by Rs. 95.6 billion in 2018, compared

to the sharp increase of Rs. 287.5 billion observed

in the previous year. This was mainly a result

of the increase in foreign liabilities, in particular

with international organisations. The contraction

in NFA was also a result of the supply of foreign

exchange by the Central Bank in the domestic

foreign exchange market during 2018 to prevent

a disorderly adjustment of the exchange rate.

The money multiplier, which reflects the link

between reserve money and broad money (M2b),

increased in 2018 mainly due to the decline in the

currency to deposit ratio in a high interest rate

environment. The broad money multiplier increased to

7.42 by end 2018, compared to 6.71 recorded at end

2017, while on average, the money multiplier increased

to 6.92 in 2018 compared to 6.63 in 2017. The currency

to deposit ratio also declined from 7.5 per cent at end

2017 to 7.1 per cent by end 2018. The reduction in SRR

with effect from 16 November 2018 also caused an

increase in the money multiplier by increasing the ability

of the banking system to create money.

Narrow Money (M1)

Narrow money (M1) expanded moderately in

2018. Narrow money, which comprises currency

and demand deposits held by the public, grew

by 4.7 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2018,

compared to the growth of 2.1 per cent recorded

at end 2017, largely on account of expansion in

currency in circulation compared to the previous

year. Continuation of the moderate narrow money

growth for the third consecutive year reflected

the increased opportunity cost of holding non-

interest-bearing deposits and currency amidst

high market interest rates. However, continuing

the trend for high demand for cash as a payment

means, currency held by the public increased by

7.7 per cent, year-on-year, to Rs. 473.1 billion

by end 2018, in comparison to the growth of 2.3

per cent at end 2017, contributing around 90 per

cent to the expansion in narrow money during

the year, compared to the contribution of 59 per

cent in 2017. Meanwhile, the growth in demand

deposits held by the public with commercial

banks remained subdued, recording a marginal

increase of 1.1 per cent, year-on-year, by end

2018, compared to 2.0 per cent recorded at

end 2017. In absolute terms, demand deposits

held by the public increased marginally by

Rs. 3.8 billion to Rs. 357.7 billion by end 2018,

compared to Rs. 353.9 billion at end 2017.

Broad Money (M2b) and Domestic Credit

Broad money (M2b) growth, which gradually

moderated since late 2017, maintained its

decelerating trend throughout the year, largely

on account of the contraction in NFA of the

banking system. During 2018, the average growth

of broad money was 14.7 per cent in comparison to

19.6 per cent in the previous year. The expansion in

broad money during 2018 was entirely attributable to

the expansion in NDA of the banking system, since

NFA of the banking system recorded a contraction.

The decline of foreign reserves of the Central Bank

as well as the foreign currency financial position

of commercial banks, amidst capital outflows and

pressures on the exchange rate led to the decline

in NFA of the banking sector.

As per the liabilities side of M2b, the increase

in time and savings deposits held by the public

with commercial banks largely contributed to

the expansion in M2b. In response to high interest

rates offered on deposits during 2018, time and

savings deposits held by the public with commercial

banks grew by 14.2 per cent, year-on-year, thus

contributing around 95 per cent to the expansion in

M2b. High return on deposits offered by commercial

banks attracted a considerable amount of deposits

to the commercial banking system, as reflected

in the expansion of time and savings deposits by

Rs. 782.7 billion in 2018, following the increase of

Rs. 885.8 billion in 2017.

Viewed from the assets side, reflecting

a reversal compared to 2017, NFA of the

banking system contracted in 2018 with the

decline in NFA of both the Central Bank and

commercial banks, thus contributing to a

moderate growth in M2b. NFA of the banking

system, which turned positive since September

2017 returned to negative levels from October

2018. NFA of the banking system declined by

Rs. 188.5 billion during 2018 in contrast to the

notable increase of Rs. 352.8 billion recorded

in 2017. NFA of the Central Bank contracted

by Rs. 95.6 billion in 2018, compared to an

increase of Rs. 287.5 billion in 2017, mainly due

to increased foreign currency liabilities, with

the receipt of funds under the Extended Fund

Facility of the IMF and the increase in foreign

currency liabilities in Deputy Secretary Treasury

(DST) accounts as well as the increase in the

allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDR)

by the IMF during the period under review.

Although, Central Bank investments in foreign

securities recorded an increase during 2018,

its impact was negated by the supply of foreign

exchange by the Central Bank in the domestic

foreign exchange market. Meanwhile, NFA of

commercial banks declined by Rs. 92.9 billion

during 2018, compared to an increase of

Rs. 65.2 billion in the previous year. NFA of

domestic banking units (DBUs) of commercial

banks decreased by Rs. 51.0 billion mainly

due to the increase in foreign currency deposit

liabilities of non-residents and the increase in

borrowings from banks abroad, although there

was an increase in placements with banks

abroad. At the same time, NFA of offshore

banking units (OBUs) also recorded a decline

of Rs. 41.9 billion in 2018, due to higher foreign

currency borrowings than placements with

banks abroad during the period under review.

Driven by increased credit flows to both private

and public sectors, NDA of the banking sector

expanded significantly, contributing entirely

to monetary growth in 2018. In absolute terms,

NDA increased significantly by Rs. 1,008.8 billion in

2018, compared to Rs. 549.7 billion recorded by end

2017. The expansion in NDA was mainly attributable

to the considerable increase in credit flows to the

private sector, as well as the surge in credit to the

government and SOBEs during the year. Meanwhile,

other liabilities of the banking sector also increased

significantly during the year, partly on account of

commercial banks’ effort to enhance capital funds, as

stipulated by the minimum capital requirement under

the Basel III framework. This limited the expansion in

NDA.

Net Credit to the Government (NCG) from the

banking system increased substantially in 2018.

During the first eight months of 2018, NCG increased

only by Rs. 103.4 billion, but increased sharply

thereafter, resulting in an overall expansion of

Rs. 346.7 billion for 2018. This was mainly due to the

increased reliance of the government on domestic

financing amidst delays in the receipt of foreign

financial flows and the shortfall in revenue collection,

compared to budget estimates. The increase in NCG

was driven by the expansion in credit from the Central

Bank and commercial banks during the period under

review. Accordingly, NCG from the Central Bank

increased by Rs. 246.3 billion in comparison to a

significant contraction of Rs. 187.9 billion in 2017.

The increase in NCG from the Central Bank was

reflected in the significant increase in Treasury bill

holdings of the Central Bank (net of repurchase

transactions) amounting to Rs. 247.4 billion in

order to inject rupee liquidity to the domestic market

through OMOs, while provisional advances to the

government recorded a marginal decline during the

year. NCG from commercial banks increased by

Rs. 100.5 billion in 2018 in comparison to the

significant increase of Rs. 384.3 billion in 2017.

Contributing to this expansion, NCG by DBUs

increased by Rs. 66.6 billion, due to the increase

in government overdraft balances with commercial

banks by Rs. 100.3 billion and investments in

SLDBs and Treasury bills by Rs. 90.0 billion and

Rs. 18.8 billion, respectively, amidst a contraction in

investments in Treasury bonds by Rs. 104.0 billion.

At the same time, NCG by OBUs increased by

around Rs. 33.9 billion due to the increase in direct

loans to the government.

Reflecting the increased reliance on bank

financing by most SOBEs, credit to public

corporations increased substantially in 2018.

Credit obtained by public corporations, which

increased by Rs. 23.2 billion in 2017, expanded

by Rs. 218.4 billion in 2018. During the year, credit

obtained by two key SOBEs, namely, Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and Ceylon Electricity

Board (CEB) accounted for around 72 per cent of

the overall expansion in credit to public corporations.

Borrowings by CPC from the commercial banking

sector increased by Rs.116.2 billion in 2018,

particularly driven in the last quarter of 2018, in

contrast to repayments made in the previous year.

Despite borrowings by CPC, particularly from OBUs

of commercial banks, a notable increase in rupee

deposits of CPC at DBUs of commercial banks could

also be witnessed during 2018. In addition, credit

obtained by CEB, Road Development Authority

(RDA), SriLankan Airlines (SLA) and National

Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB)

increased by Rs. 40.2 billion, Rs. 30.9 billion,

Rs. 16.0 billion and Rs. 15.3 billion, respectively,

during 2018. Meanwhile, three other SOBEs, namely

Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation, Colombo Fertilizer

Corporation and Sri Lanka Ports Authority made a

total repayment of around Rs. 13.0 billion in 2018.

Credit to the private sector by commercial

banks, which is the largest component of

domestic credit, grew at a slower pace during

the first eight months of 2018, although some

acceleration was witnessed in the last four

months of the year. The year-on-year growth of

credit extended to the private sector moderated

to 14.3 per cent by end August 2018, compared

to 14.7 per cent recorded at end 2017, but

subsequently accelerated to 15.9 per cent by end

2018. Nevertheless, the average growth of credit

to the private sector was 15.3 per cent in 2018,

compared to 18.1 per cent recorded in 2017. During

the last four months of 2018, credit growth averaged

15.9 per cent, as the private sector advanced their

borrowings in anticipation of the government and

the Central Banks’ policies to curtail import related

credit as well as the increase in import costs with

currency depreciation. In absolute terms, credit to

the private sector expanded by Rs. 762.1 billion

during 2018, compared to Rs. 613.4 billion in 2017.

As per the security-wise analysis of advances, credit

granted against Immovable Property, Plant and

Machinery, Personal Guarantees and Promissory

Notes, Other Securities and Unsecured categories

accounted for around 81 per cent of the overall

expansion in private sector credit, while credit

granted against government securities contracted

during the year. Meanwhile, partly reflecting the

impact of measures taken by the Central Bank

and the government to curb vehicle imports,

year-on-year growth of credit against Leasing and

Hire Purchase Agreements, as reflected in security

wise credit, decelerated to 3.7 per cent by end 2018,

compared to 8.3 per cent recorded at end 2017.

As per the Quarterly Survey of Commercial

Banks’ Loans and Advances to the Private

Sector, credit to the Services sector and

Personal Loans and Advances expanded

during 2018, although some moderation was

observed in the growth of credit to the Industry

sector and Agriculture and Fishing sector.

Accordingly, growth of credit to the Industry sector

decelerated to 15.3 per cent, year-on-year, by end

2018, from 19.6 per cent at end 2017. Contributing

to the slowdown in credit to the Industry sector,

credit to the Construction subsector, which

accounts for around 48 per cent of the total credit

flows to the Industry sector, recorded a moderate

growth of 14.1 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2018,

compared to a higher growth of 22.5 per cent at

end 2017, reflecting the slowdown in construction

related activities as well as input cost pressures

from currency depreciation. Nevertheless, credit

Transport Equipment; Textiles and Apparel; Food

during 2018. Meanwhile, credit to the Agriculture

and Fishing sector grew by 14.0 per cent,

year-on-year, by end 2018 in comparison to the

growth of 14.1 per cent at end 2017. Within this

sector, credit flows to Rubber; Vegetable, Fruit

Cultivation and Minor Food Crop subsectors

recorded a notable expansion while credit flows to

Tea; Coconut; Paddy; Livestock and Dairy Farming

and Fisheries subsectors moderated in 2018.

Credit to the Services sector grew notably by 17.8

per cent, year-on-year, by end 2018, compared

to 8.3 per cent recorded at end 2017. Reflecting

increased credit flows to leasing companies, finance

companies and other financial intermediaries

by the banking sector, credit to Financial and

Business Services subsector grew by 29.3 per cent,

year-on-year, by end 2018, compared to the

negative growth of 0.5 per cent at end 2017. Further,

credit expansion in the Services sector was also

supported by lending to Transport and Shipping,

Aviation and Freight Forwarding subsectors.

However, expansion in credit to the Wholesale

and Retail Trade and Tourism subsectors recorded

some moderation during the year. Meanwhile,

Personal Loans and Advances grew by 20.3 per

cent, year-on-year, by end 2018, in comparison

to the growth of 18.5 per cent at end 2017.

Within Personal Loans and Advances, growth of

pawning advances accelerated to 15.7 per cent,

year-on-year, by end 2018, from 12.1 per cent at

end 2017. Credit disbursed to purchase consumer

durables as well as credit on account of credit cards

also increased considerably in 2018. Moreover,

in terms of maturity analysis of outstanding credit

to the private sector by commercial banks, an

increase was observed both in short term and

long term credit, while a marginal slowdown was

observed in medium term credit. Accordingly, both

short term and long term credit growth accelerated

to 17.6 per cent and 21.7 per cent, respectively,

by end 2018, compared to 15.0 per cent and 19.0

per cent, respectively, observed at end 2017.

Meanwhile, medium term credit growth moderated

money supply (M2b). Year-on-year growth in M4

declined to 12.0 per cent by end 2018, compared

to a higher growth of 17.6 per cent recorded at end

2017. The growth in M4 was driven entirely by the

expansion in NDA. Increased credit disbursements

to both the private and public sectors contributed

to the expansion in NDA, while NFA recorded a

contraction during the year.

On the liabilities side of M4, the growth of

quasi money, which contains time and savings

deposits of licensed banks and licensed

finance companies (LFCs), moderated to

12.7 per cent by end 2018, compared to 19.7

per cent recorded at end 2017. As per the

institutional breakdown, the increase in time and

savings deposits of LFCs was only 1.0 per cent,

year-on-year, by end 2018, recording a sharp

slowdown during the year, compared to the growth

of 29.4 per cent at end 2017, partly attributing to

the precautionary behaviour of savers. The year-

on-year growth of time and savings deposits

with Licensed Specialised Banks (LSBs) also

decelerated to 11.3 per cent by end 2018, from

15.2 per cent growth recorded at end 2017.

As per M4, the year-on-year growth of credit

extended to the private sector was at 14.9 per

cent by end 2018, compared to 14.6 per cent at

end 2017. Credit growth averaged 15.2 per cent

in 2018, compared to 17.5 per cent in 2017. In

addition to the increase in credit to the private sector

by commercial banks, as observed in M2b, credit

disbursements by LFCs contributed largely to the

overall expansion in private sector credit under M4.

Credit disbursed to the private sector by LFCs grew

7.5 Future Developments,

Challenges and Outlook

After several years of debate and

deliberations in academic and policy circles,

the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is currently on

the verge of adopting flexible inflation targeting

(FIT) as its monetary policy framework.

Following the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers

for this transition, the required legal amendments

are being drafted with revisions to the mandate

of the Central Bank and the framework for

fiscal-monetary coordination. These amendments

to the MLA, which, in addition to introducing

FIT, include limiting monetary financing of the

government budget deficit and introduction

of macroprudential authority, are expected to

ensure the independence of the Central Bank

in the conduct of monetary policy with enhanced

accountability to the Parliament and the public

as well as increased transparency. They will also

strengthen the financial system oversight functions.

Meanwhile, internal institutional arrangements with

regard to monetary policy formulation are being

streamlined further whilst improving the technical

capacity of the Central Bank to support proactive

data driven decision-making by producing improved

macroeconomic projections in a timely manner.

Most importantly, fiscal-monetary coordination

needs to be enhanced further as inflation targets are

expected to be decided jointly by the government

and the Central Bank under the new policy

framework. With a view to promoting transparency,

awareness and credibility of monetary policy, the

Central Bank continues to improve its external

communications strategy by way of issuing regular

forward looking monetary policy statements, which

will be developed into Inflation Reports under the

FIT framework. The improved communications

strategy will help the general public to understand

the framework for conducting monetary policy,

thereby anchoring inflation expectations.

Additionally, limiting monetary financing of the

government budget will strengthen the conduct

of OMOs to manage short term interest rates at

desired levels. Although monetary policy will be

increasingly effective in managing demand driven

inflation and inflation expectations in the new FIT

framework, transitory supply side disruptions to

price pressures need to be addressed through

timely intervention by the government. While the

process of fiscal consolidation must continue to

sustain inflation at desired levels in the medium

term, the government is expected to play a key role

to address short run disruptions to food supplies.

The conduct of exchange rate policy with greater

flexibility in the exchange rate will remain as the first

line of defense to dampen the impact of external

shocks and the policy interest rates are expected to

increasingly focus on domestic developments.

With inflation expected to be maintained at

mid-single digit levels on a sustained basis,

it is likely that the economy will move to a

low interest rate regime in future, and this

entails maintaining inflation at mid-single digit

to be accompanied by a gradual decline in nominal

Introduction

In January 2017, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) announced its intention to adopt flexible inflation targeting (FIT) as its monetary policy framework by 2020, with a view to maintaining low and stable inflation in the medium term in a sustained manner. As Sri Lanka gradually fulfills the prerequisites to adopt FIT as the new monetary policy framework, the choice of the inflation target (the inflation metric) has become a key policy decision that remains to be taken. This choice requires deciding on several parameters such as which price index to target, at what level the inflation target should be set, what should be the

optimal inflation target bandwidth, over what time horizon should inflation be brought back to target in case of a deviation, and who should set the target. This

article explains the thinking behind the CBSL’s current deliberations on the choice of the inflation target, as an appropriate inflation metric is a key requirement for the successful implementation of FIT.

Table B 9.1 shows some examples of different inflation metrics used by selected emerging market economies as well as advanced economies.

Urban Price Index vs National Price Index

In selecting an appropriate price index to measure headline inflation, criteria such as the accurate representation of cost of living, volatility, predictability, inflation persistence, link with inflation expectations and continuity of the chosen price index must be considered. A consumer price index is used as a target measure in most inflation targeting economies since it covers the cost of living of households. A national consumer price index captures the expenditure patterns across a nation, whereas an urban consumer price index captures the expenditure patterns of consumers in urban areas only. A national consumer price index appears to be a good measure of inflation in terms of geographical coverage. However, an urban index could be a better reflection of price trends in the market since regional prices may fluctuate substantially primarily due to differences in consumption and lifestyle patterns.

In Sri Lanka, the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) and the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) are compiled and published by the Department

of Census and Statistics (DCS), to measure consumer price inflation.1 The NCPI captures the island-wide price movements and consists of a slightly higher number of items than the CCPI, whereas the CCPI captures the price movements in urban areas of the Colombo district. In spite of the wider coverage, the NCPI may not properly capture the actual market price movements as a large share of rural population tend to consume food items produced by themselves, and the dependence on the market for such items is relatively less. Therefore, an urban price index, such as the CCPI, could capture market price movements better.

Furthermore, the weight of the food basket, which is largely subjected to supply shocks and less responsive to monetary policy, is high in the NCPI compared to the CCPI (Figure B 9.1). Urban consumers tend to spend more on non-food categories compared to their rural counterparts. With a larger food basket, the NCPI is more volatile than the CCPI, as the former is susceptible to short-term supply conditions of food items.

Further, the role of inflation expectations in shaping actual inflation is widely recognised in the formulation of forward-looking monetary policy. The inflation indicator is, therefore, expected to be closely associated with inflation expectations, and at present, the correlation between the NCPI based inflation and inflation expectations is relatively weak in comparison to that of the CCPI (Table B 9.2). Moreover, the low volatility of the CCPI in relation to the NCPI makes the former easier to forecast, which is essential under FIT. Given these considerations, it may be appropriate to use CCPI, which is an urban price index, especially in the initial years of FIT.

Headline vs Core Inflation

Most inflation targeting economies use headline inflation as the target measure. It captures changes in the cost of living reasonably well and it is easily understood by the general public. However, it is generally understood that the narrow measure of inflation known as core inflation, better reflects the demand driven component of inflation, as headline inflation could be driven by transitory supply side factors at times. Core inflation usually excludes transitory or temporary price volatility as in the case of some commodities such as food items, energy products, etc. According to Mishkin (2007), core inflation provides stronger signals about persistent movements in inflation than headline inflation, but may not be a good communication channel as the general public tend to base their decisions on the movements of headline inflation. Furthermore, literature finds that core inflation has a weaker relationship with inflation expectations compared to headline inflation, as headline inflation has a variety of sensible linkages to price volatility such as wages, social payments and return on investment (McCauley, 2007). Accordingly, Anand et al. (2015) show that headline inflation targeting improves welfare outcomes, compared to core inflation targeting.

In Sri Lanka, the food component accounts for a significant portion of the headline consumer price index. Hence, movements in food prices remain a key driver of inflation that could lead to deviations in actual inflation from targeted levels (Figure B 9.2). Excluding volatile food, and energy and transport components enables core inflation to have a stronger predictive power than headline inflation. However, movements in inflation expectations as per the Inflation Expectations Survey also suggest that headline inflation remains a more powerful communication device than the core measure of inflation. Its impact on inflation expectations also makes headline inflation a better index for the forward-looking policy formulation necessary under FIT. Hence, similar to several other economies, headline inflation measure appears to be a more appropriate target for inflation under FIT in Sri Lanka. 1.

Type of the Inflation Target

Deciding on the optimal target level for inflation is also important. Inflation targeting economies have specified three types of targets: point, point with tolerance band or a target range. Countries with a point target for inflation specifies the target as a single number (E.g. 2 per cent). However, it is hard to pursue a point target for an economy like Sri Lanka as supply side factors have a significant influence on headline inflation. As it is difficult to attain an exact point target, many economies target a point complemented with a tolerance band. Therefore, if a central bank announces a point target with a tolerance band, the public would be aware of the possibility of any transitory deviations from the point target. On the other hand, a range target is specified with a lower and upper bound without any reference to a point target. In this setup, there is no requirement for the central banks to bring inflation back to the middle of the band. One disadvantage of this type of target is that anchoring inflation expectations firmly could be difficult as there is no point target. Therefore, most inflation targeting economies use a point target with a tolerance band (Table B 9.1).

Although Sri Lanka’s inflation has been highly volatile prior to 2008, a notable reduction in volatility has been observed since then. The CBSL has been able

to stabilise CCPI based headline inflation in single digits, and more recently within the implicit target range of 4.0-6.0 per cent (Figure B 9.3). The improved inflation performance is also partly due to the low inflation world that has prevailed since the global financial crisis (2008).

Under the current monetary policy framework, the CBSL has been able to maintain inflation based on both the CCPI and the NCPI at around 4.5 per cent, on average, since 2015. In terms of volatility, it has been observed that the standard deviation of NCPI based inflation is higher at 2.6 per cent when compared to the standard deviation of 1.9 per cent for CCPI based inflation (Figure B 9.4). Therefore, targeting a reasonably wide band with a midpoint of around 5 per cent would be suitable for Sri Lanka in the early stages of implementing FIT, and the band could be narrowed once the credibility of FIT improves over time.

How should the target be set?

Another fundamental aspect when determining the appropriate inflation metric is deciding on how the inflation target should be set, i.e., what is the appropriate target horizon and which entity is responsible for setting the target.

In spite of the presence of a target band, maintaining inflation at desired levels could become challenging at times due to exogenous shocks emanating from the global and domestic developments. Moreover, the long and variable lags of monetary transmission require a considerable period of time for inflation to respond to monetary policy actions. While there are arguments favouring both longer and shorter policy horizons, setting an appropriate target horizon, which defines the time it takes for inflation to return to the target level following a deviation, is essential, thereby aiding the successful anchoring of inflation expectations and policy credibility (Plantier, 2002). The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the pioneer inflation targeter, set its initial target horizon to 12 months, and revised it later to five years once inflation was successfully brought down to the desired level. The Czech National Bank, which had to cope with historically high levels of inflation, had a higher inflation target initially for the near term, which was then gradually lowered over time to rein in and guide inflation along the desired path. With inflation receding to desired low levels, the inflation target horizon was changed from near to medium term. The Reserve Bank of India, which adopted FIT in 2014, initially stipulated a time horizon of two years for the achievement of the inflation target (Reserve Bank of India, 2014). With inflation returning to desired levels, a medium term target for inflation was set thereafter. Considering the statistical relationships between short term interest rates, real output and inflation as well as the vulnerability of the Sri Lankan economy to supply shocks, a medium term target horizon of 2-3 years seems appropriate for Sri Lanka at the beginning.

While the long-term price stability objective is usually stipulated in the central bank legislation, there are three models as to who should set the medium term inflation target: the central bank alone, the government alone, or jointly by the central bank and the government. The argument that a central bank should conduct monetary policy to achieve a target set externally has prompted governments in several economies to intervene in setting medium term inflation targets. However, in a transitory period of disinflation, where inflation is not at its long-term target at the time of the adoption of the inflation targeting framework, the central bank may have far more expertise in technically evaluating the disinflation path and setting the medium term target, avoiding time inconsistent policies influenced by politicians (Hammond, 2011 and Mishkin, 2001). On the other hand, when inflation is sufficiently low and the medium term target is likely to be the same as the long term target, there are neither technicalities involved nor conflicts between who determines the inflation target, and the government could become the target setter. To bring in the technical expertise of the

2. As per the country study by Hammond (2011), which surveyed twenty seven countries that practiced fully fledged inflation targeting, the medium term inflation target of fifteen countries were jointly determined, while inflation targets of nine countries were determined solely by the central bank. Only three countries, namely Norway, South Africa and the United Kingdom, follow the practice of the government being the sole authority that determines the inflation target.

central bank in determining the medium term inflation target alongside the government’s commitment to adhere to the inflation target, the current practice of various inflation targeting economies and relevant literature2 suggest that the joint determination of the inflation target is preferable, especially for emerging market economies.

Conclusion

Following the announcement of the intention to adopt FIT by 2020, the CBSL is currently in the process of evaluating the available choices with regard to appropriate inflation metrics and other related decisions, vis-à-vis the international best practices. An initial assessment, as discussed above, shows that headline inflation based on an urban consumer price index, targeting mid-single digit level inflation with a reasonably wide tolerance band over a target horizon of 2-3 years, which is jointly decided by both the government and the CBSL would be appropriate for Sri Lanka. The forthcoming amendments to the Monetary Law Act requires a monetary policy framework agreement to be signed between the government and the CBSL to stipulate the above choices, enabling the operationalisation of FIT and facilitating the achievement of the monetary policy objective of price stability.

while encouraging the financial sector to introduce

sustainable, long term financial products, which

provide reasonable real returns to investors.

A key policy paradox that continues to

puzzle policymakers is the continuation of

domestic credit expansion despite elevated

nominal and real interest rates, while economic

growth remains subpar. With improvements

in supply side factors, appropriate demand

management policies of the Central Bank

and the government’s attempts towards fiscal

consolidation, inflation remains subdued, while

interest rates have remained high in both nominal

and real terms for a considerable period of time. In

spite of such high interest rates, credit obtained by

the private sector has expanded notably in recent

years. However, irrespective of credit expansion,

economic growth has remained subpar and below

potential for several consecutive quarters. The

subpar growth may be partly attributed to the

non-optimal allocation of credit towards less

productive sectors with a bias towards consumption

related imports. In order to ensure price stability as

well as to achieve sustained economic growth, it is

imperative that the research community, academia

and policymakers investigate the policy paradox,

thus giving rise to research-backed policies to

promote investments in more productive sectors of

the economy.
