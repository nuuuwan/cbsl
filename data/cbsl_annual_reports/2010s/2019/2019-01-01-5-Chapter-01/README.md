1.1 OverviewT

he vulnerability of the Sri Lankan economy

to global and domestic disturbances

became increasingly visible in 2018, with a

modest expansion in real economic activity amidst

a low inflation environment during the year. Real

GDP growth was recorded at 3.2 per cent in 2018,

compared to 3.4 per cent in the previous year.

This growth was largely supported by services

activities that expanded by 4.7 per cent and the

recovery in agriculture activities, which recorded

a growth of 4.8 per cent. Industry activities

slowed down significantly to 0.9 per cent during

the year, mainly as a result of the contraction

in construction. According to the expenditure

approach, both consumption and investment

expenditure supported growth. Investment as

a percentage of GDP stood at 28.6 per cent in

2018 compared to 28.8 per cent in the previous

year, while the savings-investment gap widened

during the year indicating increased dependence

on external resources to fill the shortfall. The total

size of the Sri Lankan economy was estimated at

US dollars 88.9 billion, while the per capita GDP

was recorded at US dollars 4,102 in 2018, which

was marginally lower than in the previous year.

Amidst the moderate growth in economic activity,

a marginal increase in the unemployment rate and

a decline in the labour force participation rate were

observed during the year.

The external sector of the economy was volatile

during the year due to both global and domestic

factors. Globally, monetary policy normalisation,

particularly in the United States of America (USA),

resulted in global financial conditions tightening,

thus causing capital outflows from emerging

market economies and increased pressure on

exchange rates of twin deficit economies, in

particular. Sri Lanka also experienced these

headwinds, particularly from mid-April 2018,

which were exacerbated following the political

uncertainties and the downgrade of the country’s

Sovereign rating in the fourth quarter of the year.

Domestically, the trade deficit surpassed US

dollars 10 billion for the first time in history with

higher growth in import expenditure outpacing the

growth in export earnings, which were at a record

level in nominal terms. Although services exports

are estimated to have grown substantially, the

deficit in the merchandise trade balance, stagnant

workers’ remittances and rising foreign interest

payments resulted in a widened current account

1

deficit of 3.2 per cent of GDP during the year. The

financial account benefitted from increased foreign

direct investment (FDI) inflows which recorded

its historically highest level in 2018, as well as

borrowing from abroad, particularly through the

issuance of International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs).

The combined result of these developments was

a deficit in the overall balance in the balance

of payments (BOP). In 2018, the Central Bank

followed a market based exchange rate policy

and allowed a sharper depreciation of the rupee,

but intervened in the domestic foreign exchange

market, particularly at times when large capital

outflows and undue speculation caused excessive

volatility in the market. In order to address the

widening trade deficit, the Central Bank and the

government implemented a series of measures

to curb non-essential imports by increasing tariffs,

imposing margin requirements, tightening loan-

to-value ratios on selected types of lending, and

suspending the issuance of letters of credit (LCs)

on concessionary permits for vehicle imports.

In response to these measures and the global

financial markets becoming less unfavourable,

the pressure on the BOP and the exchange rate

subsided during late 2018 and early 2019, and

the Sri Lankan rupee appreciated against major

currencies during the first quarter of 2019, thus

correcting the overshooting of the exchange rate

observed in the previous year to some extent. The

resumption of discussions and the achievement

of staff level agreement with the International

Monetary Fund (IMF) on the programme under

the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement in

February 2019 also helped improve investment

sentiments.

In spite of the sharp depreciation of the rupee and

the introduction of the pricing formula for domestic

petroleum price adjustments, headline and core

inflation remained well anchored in low single digit

levels during the year, supported by proactive

monetary policy measures, improved domestic

supply conditions, and also due to subdued

aggregate demand conditions. Headline inflation

fluctuated largely in line with the price movements

of the food category, where food prices declined

mostly during 2018 owing to favourable weather

conditions that prevailed during the year. Inflation

is expected to remain well within mid single digit

levels in the medium term, particularly under the

envisaged flexible inflation targeting (FIT) regime.

Subdued inflation and inflation expectations

and lower than potential growth in real economic

activity prompted the Central Bank to signal an

end to the monetary tightening cycle in April

2018 by reducing the Standing Lending Facility

Rate (SLFR) by 25 basis points. Thereafter, the

Central Bank maintained a neutral monetary

policy stance throughout the year, in view of the

continued pressure on the external sector amidst

the subpar performance in the domestic economy.

Nevertheless, the large and persistent liquidity

deficit in the domestic money market, particularly

since September 2018, compelled the Central

Bank to inject liquidity on a permanent basis in

November 2018, by way of reducing the Statutory

Reserve Ratio (SRR) applicable on all rupee

deposit liabilities of commercial banks by 1.50

percentage points. However, at the same time,

to neutralise the impact of the SRR reduction

and maintain its neutral policy stance, the Central

Bank increased the Standing Deposit Facility Rate

(SDFR) by 75 basis points and SLFR by 50 basis

points, further narrowing the policy rate corridor to

100 basis points. Accordingly, by end 2018, SDFR

and SLFR stood at 8.00 per cent and 9.00 per cent,

respectively. As the shortage in rupee liquidity

persisted into early 2019, the Central Bank reduced

the SRR by a further 1.00 percentage point to 5.00

per cent effective 01 March 2019. Meanwhile,

3

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

the year-on-year growth of broad money (M2b)

decelerated in 2018 driven by the contraction in

net foreign assets (NFA) of the banking sector.

However, within broad money growth, the overall

expansion of credit granted to the private sector

by commercial banks in 2018 was higher than

expected, in spite of tight liquidity conditions and

high nominal and real market interest rates.

In the meantime, fiscal operations during

2018 demonstrated some improvements with

a higher primary surplus and a lower budget

deficit, notwithstanding the decline in revenue

mobilisation. The government revenue declined

to 13.3 per cent of GDP in 2018 while expenditure

and net lending declined, particularly due to lower

public investment, which was affected by political

tensions that prevailed towards the end of the

year resulting in delays in the implementation of

budgetary operations. Reduced capital expenditure

also contributed to a dampening of economic

activity. The current account deficit increased in

2018 as a percentage of GDP reflecting dissavings

of the government. The primary balance, which

mirrors the difference between the government

revenue and non-interest expenditure, registered a

surplus of 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2018 compared

to the surplus of 0.02 per cent of GDP in 2017. The

budget deficit declined to 5.3 per cent of GDP in

2018 from 5.5 per cent of GDP in 2017 as a result

of the substantial reduction in capital expenditure,

but a deviation from the target level of 4.8 per cent

of GDP envisaged in the Budget 2018 was also

observed. The outstanding central government

debt increased to 82.9 per cent of GDP at end

2018 from 76.9 per cent at end 2017, which is

attributed to the depreciation of the rupee that

affected the rupee value of foreign debt, relatively

low nominal GDP and higher net borrowings

during the period. Rollover risks can be contained

through the implementation of the provisions of the

Active Liability Management Act (ALMA) and the

introduction of the Medium Term Debt Management

Strategy (MTDS), which would help manage the

government’s debt obligations in the period ahead,

with the support of continued commitment towards

revenue based fiscal consolidation.

The financial sector continued to expand in

2018, supported by the moderate but stable growth

of the banking sector. However, the profitability of

the banking sector declined during the year mainly

due to some deterioration in the asset quality,

a rise in operating costs and higher taxes. The

Central Bank strengthened the prudential policy

measures, including the implementation of Basel

III requirements and the adoption of Sri Lanka

Accounting Standard - SLFRS 9 during the year.

Meanwhile, the Licensed Finance Companies

(LFCs) and Specialised Leasing Companies

(SLCs) sector also recorded moderate growth

amidst a challenging environment, and the Central

Bank took measures to resolve distressed finance

companies and to address the lingering concerns

in the sector. The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE)

recorded yet another year of poor performance due

to adverse developments on domestic and global

fronts, which affected investor sentiments.

While Sri Lanka has made significant progress

in maintaining price stability in the past decade,

progress in terms of real economic performance has

fallen below expectations in recent years impacted

by the continued delays in the implementation of

the required structural reforms and inconsistent

and unpredictable policies introduced from time to

time. These irregularities have crippled the growth

momentum of the economy, thus preventing the

country from progressing into a higher income

economy. In this background, it is vital that all

stakeholders make concerted efforts to expedite

the reform agenda that is already in place, which

includes the National Export Strategy (NES) and

4

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

1

New Trade Policy (NTP) to improve earnings

from merchandise and service exports, the fiscal

consolidation programme to improve fiscal discipline

and debt sustainability, and the Central Bank’s

move towards adopting FIT by 2020 to ensure

sustained price stability. The timely implementation

of these reforms will not only improve Sri Lanka’s

economic outlook and its prospects as a highly

sought after destination for investments given the

country’s strategic location in the Indian Ocean, but

also would be essential to uplift the overall standard

of living and quality of life of its people.

1.2 Macroeconomic

Developments, Stability and Policy Responses in 2018

Real Sector Developments and Inflation

As per the provisional estimates of Gross

Domestic Product (GDP) released by the

Department of Census and Statistics (DCS),

the Sri Lankan economy continued to record

a modest growth of 3.2 per cent in 2018 in

real terms, compared to the growth of 3.4 per

cent in 2017. Agriculture activities grew by 4.8

per cent in 2018, indicating a recovery from the

effect of extreme weather conditions experienced

in the previous year. Accordingly, growing of rice

recorded a notable growth while other cereals

and vegetables also supported growth in 2018.

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1National accounts estimates are a key gauge used by macroeconomic policymakers, investors and other stakeholders to measure the direction of an economy with a view to making various decisions. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that accurate national accounts estimates, which are regularly updated to capture the evolving structure of the economy, are made available on a timely basis by a country’s national statistical agency.

In 2015, with a landmark revision to the method of compiling national accounts, Sri Lanka’s national statistical agency, the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), moved the base year of GDP from 2002 to 2010 with the objectives of enhancing the accuracy of GDP estimates and representing the true structure of the economy. In the rebasing process, DCS made several improvements such as the adoption of international classifications and the adoption of the United Nations System of National Accounts – 2008 (SNA – 2008) compilation methodologies. Accordingly, from the first quarter of 2015, Sri Lanka’s national accounts are compiled with 2010 as the base year, and it is expected that DCS will rebase national accounts from time to time in order to capture new economic activities taking place in the country, particularly through improved survey coverage.1

Along with this change in the base year, DCS also introduced a revision policy of national accounts estimates from 2015. According to the revision policy, “provisional estimates” are prepared and published around 75 days after the respective quarter, broadly following an advance release calendar. When annual estimates are published, revised estimates for the first three quarters of the same year and for the two previous years are also published as “revised provisional estimates”. When final data becomes available, “final quarterly and annual national accounts estimates” are released.

Although the concepts of base year revisions and the revision of provisional national accounts estimates as per the revision policy of DCS are in line with international best practices,2 frequent revisions have made data-driven evidence-based decision making challenging for policymakers as well as investors. Such challenges are common to many economies,3 but large revisions that

BOX 1The Impact of Frequent Large Revisions to National Accounts Estimates on Macroeconomic Indicators and Macroeconomic Policymaking

cannot be explained using established macroeconomic linkages are not desirable, especially when the first provisional estimate of national accounts is released around 2½ to 3 months after the end of each quarter.

Figure B 1.1 shows the effect of the latest rebasing of national accounts on quarterly real GDP growth rates, as discussed in the Central Bank Annual Report 2015. For example, real GDP growth rate in 2012-Q1, which was estimated at 8.0 per cent under the base year 2002, was recorded at 16.1 per cent under the base year 2010, while real GDP growth rate in 2013-Q4, which was estimated at 8.2 per cent under the base year 2002, was estimated at 0.5 per cent under the base year 2010.

Table B 1.1 shows the impact of recent revisions on national accounts (2010 base) based on the expenditure approach, by comparing national accounts released in July 2018 and March 2019, i.e., within a space of eight months. Accordingly, both consumption and investment (gross capital formation) shares of GDP have been substantially revised for the period after 2016. Consumption as a share of GDP, which was estimated at 72.4 per cent for 2016 and 70.5 per cent for 2017, has been sharply revised upwards to 79.4 per cent for 2016 and 78.3 per cent for 2017, while it has been estimated at 78.8 per cent for 2018. On the other hand, investment as a share of GDP, which was estimated at 35.0 per cent for 2016 and 36.7 per cent for 2017, has been sharply revised downwards to 27.9 percent for 2016 and 28.8 per cent for 2017. It is estimated at 28.6 per cent for 2018. Although the revised shares of investment in GDP for 2016-2018 appear to be more aligned with the recent growth path of the economy, the sharp drop in investment to GDP share from 39.1 per cent in 2012, to 31.2 per cent in 2015 and further to 28.6 per cent in 2018 remains unexplained, and questions the accuracy and credibility of national accounts.

1. It is observed that the growth estimates of DCS for recent years have been considerably below the growth projections of several domestic and international agencies engaged in economic analysis, and at times, not in line with the movement of other macroeconomic indicators. It is expected that DCS will address the deficiencies in data coverage and quality in GDP compilation, at the upcoming revisions as well as future releases of GDP estimates. Nevertheless, the purpose of this Box Article is not to discuss such deficiencies, but to highlight the challenges faced by the economy due to frequent large revisions to national accounts estimates.

Economic decisions are made, based on the statistics available at the time of decision making, and most often, policy decisions cannot be reversed even when there is a large subsequent revision to already published data. For instance, one key input for the monetary policy decision making process is the output gap, which is the difference between actual output and the potential output of the economy. Frequent large revisions to national accounts estimates invalidate estimates of potential output as well as the output gap, and a real time decision to tighten or relax monetary policy could have a harmful impact on the economy, which cannot be remedied when revised national accounts estimates become available later. With regard to fiscal indicators, revenue, expenditure, key fiscal balances, and debt levels are generally expressed as ratios of GDP, and fiscal policy decisions

made on currently available indicators will also have a real effect on the economy, irrespective of subsequent revisions to national accounts estimates. Investors also closely watch GDP data releases, as they are the most crucial indicator for economic activity, and it is not helpful to realise that the economy has performed exceptionally well, or otherwise, years after the initial data release, as investors would have made real time investment decisions by then.

Therefore, the macroeconomic cost of the non-availability of accurate data on time is high, and this is a key factor that needs to be taken into consideration in making future revisions more transparent and when designing rebasing exercises and advance release calendars.

sector also reflected the base effect of the drought

affected growth in 2017. Meanwhile, the growth

momentum in industry activities moderated

considerably during the year to 0.9 per cent from

4.1 per cent in the previous year. The slowdown

in industry related activities was particularly due

to the contraction in construction, and mining and

quarrying activities during the year. However, the

performance of manufacturing, and electricity,

water and waste treatment activities contributed

towards the expansion in industry activities.

Services sector, which is the largest production

sector within GDP, grew by 4.7 per cent in 2018

compared to the expansion of 3.6 per cent in the

previous year. Within services activities, financial

services continued to be the main contributor to

economic expansion followed by wholesale and

retail trade activities.

As per the GDP estimates based on

the expenditure approach, the expansion

in consumption as well as investment

expenditure supported nominal economic

growth in 2018. However, consumption

expenditure, which accounted for a share of

78.8 per cent of GDP, recorded a slowdown

from a growth rate of 10.3 per cent in 2017 to an

Per cent

expansion of 8.3 per cent in 2018. This slowdown

in consumption expenditure was due to the

moderation in the growth of private consumption

expenditure while public consumption expenditure

grew at a higher rate compared to the previous

year. Meanwhile, investment expenditure, which

recorded an expansion of 15.8 per cent in 2017,

grew by 6.8 per cent amidst a modest nominal

growth in construction activities during the

year. With these developments, investment as

a percentage of GDP fell marginally to 28.6 per

cent in 2018 from 28.8 per cent in the previous

year. Accordingly, domestic demand grew by 7.9

per cent while net external demand deteriorated

by 10.3 per cent in 2018. Meanwhile, domestic

savings as a percentage of GDP fell marginally

to 21.2 per cent in 2018 from 21.7 per cent in

the previous year. Moreover, national savings

also declined as a percentage of GDP to 25.4

per cent in 2018 compared to 26.2 per cent in

2017. This was a result of the marginal decline in

domestic savings and continued deterioration of

net primary income from rest of the world amidst

the modest expansion in net current transfers.

Accordingly, both the domestic savings-

investment gap and national savings-investment

gap widened marginally to 7.3 per cent and 3.1

per cent, respectively, during 2018.

Underpinned by favourable weather

conditions, agriculture activities recovered in

2018 and registered a growth of 4.8 per cent,

compared to the contraction of 0.4 per cent

observed in the previous year. Production in

several agriculture crops, including paddy, coconut,

fruits, livestock, vegetables and other field crops

increased during 2018, while tea, rubber, fisheries

and sugar production recorded a decline. Paddy

production, which was affected by adverse weather

conditions in 2017, recovered with an increase

of 64.9 per cent, resulting in a production of 3.9

million metric tons during 2018. The significant

improvement in paddy production in both seasons

were supported by conducive weather conditions

and sufficient availability of water for paddy

cultivation. In response to increased availability

of domestic paddy stocks, rice imports witnessed

a considerable decline of 66.7 per cent in 2018

compared to the previous year. Although the

domestic supply of rice improved considerably, the

average price of selected rice varieties remained at

elevated levels during 2018. Unfavourable weather

conditions in tea growing areas, particularly during

the second quarter of 2018, and wage related trade

union action in the plantation sector affected tea

production during 2018, amidst lower average prices

of tea. Rubber production also declined during

the year due to continued rainfall during tapping

days in rubber plantation areas and high cost of

production. Meanwhile, supported by sufficient rain,

coconut production recorded an expansion during

2018. Production of other field crops increased

although the Fall Armyworm infestation during

the last quarter of the year in certain parts of the

country severely damaged maize and finger millet

(kurakkan) production. Meanwhile, the production

of vegetables, fruits and milk recorded an expansion

in 2018 while sugar production contracted for

the second consecutive year. Egg production

contracted during 2018, while meat production

recorded a modest growth. The fisheries sector

witnessed a marginal setback in 2018 following the

marginal expansion recorded in 2017.

During 2018, industry related activities

experienced a slowdown, particularly with

the decline in construction, and mining and

quarrying activities. Construction activities, which

accounted for 6.8 per cent of GDP, contracted by 2.1

per cent during 2018 compared to the expansion of

4.3 per cent recorded in the previous year. In tandem

with the decline in construction activities, mining

and quarrying activities also contracted during the

year. Meanwhile, manufacturing activities, which

accounted for 15.5 per cent of GDP, registered a

modest growth of 3.0 per cent in 2018, supported

by increased production of sectors such as food

products, beverages, wearing apparel, rubber

and plastic products, coke and refined petroleum

products and textiles. However, production in the

subsectors of paper and paper products, chemicals

and chemical products, electrical equipment and

furniture products contracted during the period

under review. Meanwhile, electricity, water and

waste treatment activities also contributed to

economic growth with an expansion of 4.7 per cent

during 2018. The government took several policy

measures aimed at promoting the industry sector

focusing on enhancing the industrial production

capacity of the country to cater to both domestic

and global markets through increased private

sector participation.

Services related activities expanded by

4.7 per cent in 2018 compared to the growth

of 3.6 per cent recorded in the previous year.

The growth of the services sector was particularly

supported by the expansion in financial services

activities (11.8 per cent) during 2018. Meanwhile,

wholesale and retail trade activities that accounted

for 10.8 per cent of GDP, grew by 5.0 per cent

while transportation activities, which accounted for

a similar share, recorded an expansion of 2.8 per

cent in 2018. In addition, other personal services

and real estate activities grew by 4.8 per cent and

3.8 per cent, respectively, during the year. The

marginal contraction of 0.6 per cent witnessed

in public administration and defence activities

dampened the growth in services activities to some

extent in 2018.

The unemployment rate increased marginally

to 4.4 per cent in 2018 compared to 4.2 per cent

recorded during 2017. Both male and female

unemployment rates increased during the year to

3.0 per cent and 7.1 per cent, respectively, from

2.9 per cent and 6.5 per cent, respectively, in the

previous year. Meanwhile, unemployment among

youth aged 20-24 years and 25-29 years remained

high at 20.1 per cent and 10.4 per cent, respectively,

during the year. Unemployment among females

with higher education attainment, i.e., GCE A/L

and above, was notably higher at 13.2 per cent in

2018, compared to 11.3 per cent recorded during

2017. The labour force participation rate (LFPR)

fell considerably in 2018 to 51.8 per cent from 54.1

per cent during the previous year. LFPR among

both males and females declined in 2018 to 73.0

per cent and 33.6 per cent, respectively. With the

decline in LFPR amidst the marginal increase in

the unemployment rate, the employed population

declined by 2.4 per cent to 8.015 million during

2018. Meanwhile, the agriculture sector accounted

for 25.5 per cent of the employed population while

the industry and services sector shares were 27.9

per cent and 46.6 per cent, respectively, during

the year. In 2018, the total number of departures

for foreign employment continued to decline with

a fall in male departures while female departures

increased.

Despite the sharp depreciation of the rupee

against major currencies and transitory price

pressures due to upward revisions to prices

of domestic petroleum products and other

administratively determined prices, both

headline and core inflation remained subdued

in 2018 as a result of well anchored inflation

expectations under the enhanced monetary

policy framework. Headline inflation, as measured

by the year-on-year change in the Colombo

Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100), was

broadly on a downward path in 2018. The short-

lived pickup in headline inflation during mid 2018

was mainly due to cost push factors arising from

upward adjustments in domestic petroleum prices

and volatile food prices. Inflation decelerated

significantly during the latter part of the year and

reached levels even lower than the desired mid

single digit levels, primarily due to low food prices,

downward adjustment of selected administratively

determined prices as well as the reduction of the

Special Commodity Levy and Telecommunication

Levy. Accordingly, year-on-year headline inflation

based on CCPI declined to 2.8 per cent by end

2018 from 7.1 per cent at end 2017. Headline

inflation, as measured by the year-on-year change

in the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI,

2013=100), followed the same trend as CCPI,

peaking in July 2018 and remaining at low single

digit levels thereafter. Year-on-year headline

inflation based on NCPI declined sharply to 0.4

per cent by December 2018 from 7.3 per cent at

end 2017. Headline inflation, as measured by the

year-on-year change in both CCPI and NCPI,

showed some acceleration in the first quarter of

2019 mainly due to higher non-food inflation driven

by increased expenditure on certain items such as

house rentals and education. Accordingly, year-

on-year headline inflation, as measured by CCPI,

increased to 4.3 per cent by March 2019, while

NCPI based headline inflation rose to 2.4 per cent

by February 2019. Core inflation remained at low

single digit levels throughout 2018, reflecting the

lagged impact of the relatively tight monetary policy

stance maintained in the past. Year-on-year core

inflation based on CCPI decelerated to 3.1 per cent

by end 2018 from 4.3 per cent recorded at end

2017, reflecting subdued demand pressures in the

economy. NCPI based core inflation accelerated

marginally to 3.1 per cent (year-on-year) by end

2018 in comparison to 2.7 per cent at end 2017.

Price adjustments in the housing and education

sectors in January 2019 contributed to an increase

in underlying inflation, resulting in CCPI based

year-on-year core inflation accelerating to 5.6 per

cent by March 2019 and NCPI based year-on-

year core inflation accelerating to 5.5 per cent by

February 2019.

External Sector Developments

Sri Lanka’s external sector experienced a

setback during 2018, with increased foreign

exchange outflows, particularly due to higher

import expenditure and capital outflows.

The trade deficit expanded during 2018, as

the growth of import expenditure, driven by a

significant increase in the imports of vehicles and

fuel (as well as gold during early 2018), outpaced

the growth of export earnings. The deficit in

the primary income account widened with an

increase in interest payments on foreign loans by

the government and dividend payments by direct

investment enterprises (DIEs). Trade in services

recorded a notable surplus during the year, driven

mainly by earnings from tourism, transportation

and computer services sectors. Meanwhile,

workers’ remittances, which grew during the

first nine months of the year moderated in the

latter part of 2018 impacted by the prevailing

geopolitical uncertainties in the Middle Eastern

region, variations in oil prices as well as the drop

in overall labour migration. Consequently, the

current account deficit widened to 3.2 per cent of

GDP in 2018 from 2.6 per cent of GDP in 2017.

The financial account recorded notable inflows,

mainly on account of the issuance of International

Sovereign Bonds (ISBs), the receipt of the fifth

tranche of the IMF-Extended Fund Facility (IMF-

EFF), the foreign currency term financing facility

(FCTFF) and FDI inflows including proceeds

from the long-lease of the Hambantota Port.

However, foreign investment in the government

securities market and the Colombo Stock

Exchange (CSE) recorded net outflows since the

second quarter of 2018, exerting pressure on

the external sector. Further, the banking sector

also recorded a sizeable amount of international

bond maturities during the year. Gross official

reserves, which reached its historically highest

level in the first half of the year, declined by

end 2018 with an increased trade deficit, higher

foreign debt service payments, capital outflows

and the sale of foreign exchange by the Central

Bank in the domestic foreign exchange market to

counter undue fluctuations in the exchange rate.

Consequently, the overall balance of the balance

of payments (BOP) recorded a deficit of US

dollars 1.1 billion by end 2018. The broad-based

strengthening of the US dollar, political uncertainty

that prevailed in the latter part of 2018 and

tight liquidity conditions in the domestic foreign

exchange market exerted pressure on the Sri

Lankan rupee. The Central Bank allowed greater

flexibility in the determination of the exchange

rate and pursued a market based exchange rate

policy with a cautious approach in intervening

in the domestic foreign exchange market, which

took into consideration the significant volatility in

the exchange rate and the level of gross official

reserves. Consequently, the Sri Lankan rupee

depreciated by 16.4 per cent against the US

dollar in 2018, while the Central Bank supplied

US dollars 1,120 million to the domestic foreign

exchange market on a net basis. While the

depreciation pressure was partly addressed by

the Central Bank’s intervention in the foreign

exchange market, further policy measures were

taken by the Central Bank and the government

to restrain foreign exchange outflows owing to

rising import demand for gold, motor vehicles and

certain non-essential consumer goods during the

year. Meanwhile, the Real Effective Exchange

Rate (REER) index remained below the base

year level throughout 2018, reflecting continued

competitiveness of Sri Lanka’s external sector in

terms of currency movements.

The deficit in the trade account expanded

in 2018. The trade deficit widened significantly

during the first half of the year owing to high

import expenditure incurred on gold, fuel and

personal motor vehicles along with modest export

performance. However, the trade deficit improved

towards the latter part of the year as a result of

the policy measures adopted by the Central Bank

and the government to curtail import expenditure

as well as the substantial depreciation of the Sri

Lankan rupee. The overall trade deficit widened

to US dollars 10,343 million in 2018 from US

dollars 9,619 million in 2017. The trade deficit as

a percentage of GDP widened to 11.6 per cent in

2018 from 10.9 per cent in 2017.

Earnings from merchandise exports,

which rebounded strongly in 2017 continued

to grow in 2018. Accordingly, earnings from

exports grew by 4.7 per cent to US dollars 11,890

million in 2018 from US dollars 11,360 million in

2017. The restoration of the European Union -

Generalised System of Preferences Plus (EU-

GSP+) facility, conducive external trade policies

together with strong institutional support and

the flexible exchange rate policy maintained by

the Central Bank buttressed the performance of

export earnings. Earnings from industrial exports

contributed to the expansion in export earnings

in 2018, while earnings from agricultural and

mineral exports declined. Industrial exports,

which accounted for around 78 per cent of total

exports, increased by 8.4 per cent, year-on-year,

to US dollars 9,258 million in 2018. The increase

in export earnings from textiles and garments

(5.7 per cent), petroleum products (43.2 per

cent), food, beverages and tobacco (17.7 per

cent), machinery and mechanical appliances

(17.3 per cent) and rubber products (4.8 per cent)

mainly contributed to the improved performance

in industrial exports. However, contractions were

recorded in earnings from transport equipment

(-25.9 per cent), leather, travel goods and

footwear (-6.8 per cent) and printing industry

products (-35.2 per cent) during the year when

compared to the previous year. Earnings from

agricultural exports, which accounted for about

22 per cent of total exports, declined by 6.8

per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 2,579

million in 2018 due to poor performance in most

subcategories, particularly tea (-6.6 per cent),

spices (-11.3 per cent) and coconut (-10.6 per

cent). However, earnings from seafood exports

rose by 10.5 per cent with higher exports to the

EU market. Meanwhile, earnings from mineral

exports declined by 0.4 per cent, year-on-year,

due to lower earnings from earths and stones,

and precious metals. The US remained the major

export destination accounting for 25.9 per cent

of Sri Lanka’s exports, followed by the UK (8.2

per cent), India (6.5 per cent), Germany (5.2 per

cent) and Italy (4.8 per cent). Meanwhile, the

export volume index increased marginally by

0.5 per cent in 2018 while the export unit value

index increased by 4.2 per cent, implying that,

on a cumulative basis, the growth in exports

was driven mainly by higher prices rather than

volumes in 2018.

Import expenditure, which recorded a

substantial growth during the first half of

2018, gradually decelerated thereafter, as

a result of the policy measures adopted by

the Central Bank and the government as well

as the sharp depreciation of the Sri Lankan

rupee. Accordingly, import expenditure, which

13

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

grew by 10.4 per cent, year-on-year, in the first

nine months of 2018, recorded a contraction

of 5.9 per cent in the last quarter of the year.

Overall, expenditure on imports grew by 6.0

per cent to US dollars 22,233 million in 2018, in

comparison to US dollars 20,980 million in 2017.

Within this increase, expenditure on non-fuel

imports increased by 3.0 per cent to US dollars

18,081 million during the year. Expenditure on

intermediate goods imports, which accounted for

more than half of the total imports, increased by

9.2 per cent to US dollars 12,488 million mainly

led by higher expenditure incurred on fuel (21.1

per cent), textiles and textile articles (4.9 per

cent) and fertiliser (154.4 per cent). Expenditure

on gold imports also contributed significantly

to higher import growth during the first four

months of the year. Considering the possible

illicit arbitrage resulting from the tariff differential

between India and Sri Lanka on gold imports, the

government re-imposed a 15 per cent customs

duty on the importation of gold since April 2018.

As a result, import expenditure on gold declined

considerably since May 2018, with a marginal

value of around US dollars 1 million being

recorded during the remaining eight months of

the year. Further, import expenditure on rubber

and articles thereof (-6.6 per cent) and mineral

products (-14.0 per cent) decreased in 2018.

Meanwhile, consumer goods imports increased

by 10.6 per cent to US dollars 4,980 million,

mainly due to higher expenditure incurred on non-

food consumer goods, despite a considerable

reduction recorded in expenditure on food and

beverages driven by reduced importation of

rice. Expenditure on the importation of personal

motor vehicles contributed mainly to the increase

in expenditure on non-food consumer goods

imports in 2018, registering a 103.6 per cent

growth. Expenditure on personal motor vehicle

imports increased noticeably during the first eight

months of the year mainly due to the increase

in importation of vehicles with small engine

capacity, hybrid and electric vehicles as a result

of the revision to tax structure for vehicles in the

Budget 2018. Considering the pressure on the

external sector and mainly on the exchange rate

from increased vehicle imports, several policy

measures were adopted from August 2018 to

curtail such imports. As a result, expenditure

on vehicle imports declined in November and

December 2018. Further, as a result of the policy

measures by the Central Bank to discourage

non-essential consumer goods imports, such

as refrigerators, washing machines, perfumes,

mobile phones, etc., import expenditure on many

of these categories declined in 2018. Meanwhile,

expenditure on investment goods also declined

in 2018. India continued to remain the largest

source of imports registering its share at 19.0 per

cent of total imports followed by China (18.5 per

cent), United Arab Emirates (8.3 per cent), Japan

(7.1 per cent) and Singapore (6.2 per cent).

Meanwhile, the import volume index and the

import unit value index increased by 1.8 per cent

and 4.1 per cent, respectively, in 2018 indicating

that the growth of imports was driven mainly by

the price impact rather than the volume impact

during the year.

The current account deficit widened

significantly with increased trade and

primary income account deficits, despite

healthy flows to the services and secondary

income accounts during 2018. The trade

deficit expanded significantly during 2018 as

import expenditure outpaced the growth of

export earnings. This development, along with

a higher deficit in the primary income account,

led to the widening of the current account

14

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

1

deficit. Improvements in earnings of services

exports, mainly on account of higher earnings

from tourism, as well as inflows of workers’

remittances partially offset the widened current

account deficit. Tourist arrivals grew by 10.3 per

cent during 2018, while earnings from tourism

grew by 11.6 per cent to US dollars 4,381 million

in 2018 in comparison to US dollars 3,925 million

in 2017. Workers’ remittances declined by 2.1

per cent to US dollars 7,015 million in 2018,

following the decline of 1.1 per cent observed

in the previous year. Consequently, the current

account deficit is estimated to have widened to

US dollars 2.8 billion in 2018.

The financial account recorded higher

inflows, despite significant outflows from

the government securities market and the

CSE as well as debt servicing requirements

during 2018. Proceeds from the issuance of

ISBs, receipt of the FCTFF, receipt of the fifth

tranche of the IMF-EFF and FDI inflows including

proceeds from the long-lease of the Hambantota

Port supported the financial account during the

year. However, net outflows of foreign investment

from the government securities market and the

secondary market of the CSE exerted pressure on

the BOP, especially since the second quarter of

2018. These developments, together with higher

foreign currency debt service payments, resulted

in the overall balance recording a deficit of US

dollars 1,103 million by end 2018. Meanwhile,

the financial account recorded notable inflows in

the first quarter of 2019 owing to inflows to the

government securities market and issuance of

ISBs amounting to US dollars 2.4 billion in March

2019, which contributed to improve investor

sentiment, in addition to the repayment of the

maturing ISB of US dollars 1.0 billion in January

2019.

Gross official reserves, which reached the

historically highest level of US dollars 9.9

billion at end April 2018, moderated thereafter

with foreign debt service payments and Central

Bank intervention in the domestic foreign

exchange market. During the first four months

of the year, relatively stable domestic foreign

exchange market conditions enabled the Central

Bank to build up international reserves through

the absorption of foreign exchange from the

market together with the receipt of ISB proceeds

and the second tranche of the Hambantota Port

long-lease. However, tightening global financial

conditions weighed on the foreign exchange

inflows in the BOP leading to capital outflows.

Moreover, on the domestic front, the increased

demand for foreign currency from importers

and the lack of foreign exchange conversions

by exporters necessitated the Central Bank to

intervene in the domestic market by supplying

foreign exchange, particularly from May 2018

onwards, to curtail the undue depreciation

pressure on the Sri Lankan rupee. Consequently,

by end 2018, gross official reserves declined to

US dollars 6.9 billion, which was sufficient to

finance 3.7 months of imports. Thereafter, gross

official reserves are estimated to have improved

substantially with the receipt of the proceeds

from the issuance of ISBs in March 2019.

Sri Lanka’s outstanding external debt

increased, mainly due to the increase in

external debt of the general government and

direct investment enterprises (DIEs) in 2018.

The government’s external borrowings were

mainly financed by the issuance of ISBs totalling

US dollars 2.5 billion, project loan inflows of US

dollars 1.2 billion and FCTFF of US dollars 1.0

billion during the year. The outstanding liabilities of

the Central Bank increased with the receipt of the

15

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

fifth tranche of the IMF-EFF while the outstanding

liabilities with the Asian Clearing Union (ACU)

decreased compared to the beginning of 2018.

A notable decline in outstanding external debt

of deposit taking corporations was observed

with the maturing of international bonds issued

by Bank of Ceylon, National Savings Bank and

DFCC Bank totalling US dollars 1.35 billion

during 2018. Further, outstanding external debt

of intercompany borrowing of DIEs recorded an

increase while outstanding foreign loans of state

owned business enterprises (SOBEs) declined

during 2018.

The Central Bank pursued a market based

exchange rate policy with greater flexibility

in the exchange rate. The exchange rate,

which remained relatively stable in the first four

months of 2018, came under significant pressure

thereafter due to both domestic and external

factors. The Central Bank allowed greater

flexibility in the determination of the exchange

rate while intervening only to curb unwarranted

excessive volatility. During the year, Central

Bank intervention in the domestic foreign

exchange market amounted to a net supply of

US dollars 1,120 million, while the Sri Lankan

rupee depreciated by 16.4 per cent against

the US dollar in 2018, reflecting the degree of

pressure created by the tight liquidity conditions

in the domestic foreign exchange market as well

as changing global financial market conditions.

With the nominal depreciation of the Sri Lankan

rupee against some major currencies, together

with the movements in cross currency exchange

rates, both 5-currency and 24-currency Nominal

Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indices

declined during 2018. Further, the Real Effective

Exchange Rate (REER) index remained below

100 index point level throughout the year,

indicating Sri Lanka’s continued external

competitiveness. Meanwhile, reflecting greater

stability of the external sector in early 2019, the

Sri Lankan rupee appreciated against the US

dollar and most other major currencies in the first

quarter of 2019.

Assisted by the policy measures to curtail

non-essential imports and greater political

stability, the resilience of the external sector

improved somewhat towards the end of 2018

and the first quarter of 2019. The possible delay

in further rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve,

positive investor sentiment brought about by the

repayment of maturing ISB of US dollars 1 billion

in January 2019, the extension of the IMF-EFF

and the successful issuance of ISBs amounting

to US dollars 2.4 billion helped improve the

external sector outlook. These developments

were complemented by a further reduction in

the trade deficit in January 2019, which also

contributed to the appreciation of the Sri Lankan

rupee in the first quarter of 2019.

Fiscal Sector Developments

The fiscal strategy of the government

in 2018 was aimed at continuing the fiscal

consolidation measures to reduce the budget

deficit and outstanding debt, while generating

a sizable surplus in the primary balance.

The overall budget deficit improved to 5.3 per

cent of GDP in 2018 from 5.5 per cent of GDP

in the previous year, mainly due to lower capital

expenditure despite the decline in government

revenue collection. Consequently, the primary

balance, which excludes interest payments from

the overall balance, recorded a surplus of 0.6 per

cent of GDP (Rs. 91.4 billion) in 2018 thereby

supporting the fiscal consolidation efforts of the

government and improving the debt dynamics. The

current account deficit, which reflects government

dissaving, widened marginally to 1.2 per cent

of GDP in 2018, indicating lower than expected

revenue collection and overrun in recurrent

expenditure largely due to higher expenditure on

interest payments. Meanwhile, central government

debt as a percentage of GDP increased to 82.9

per cent by end 2018 from 76.9 per cent at end

2017, mainly due to the impact of the depreciation

of the rupee, relatively low nominal GDP and net

financing of the budget deficit.

Government revenue as a percentage of

GDP declined to 13.3 per cent in 2018 from

13.6 per cent recorded in 2017. The decline in

tax revenue from import duties, Value Added Tax

(VAT), excise duty on petroleum products and

liquor, withholding tax and Cess levy led to the

underperformance in revenue collection. Total

revenue in nominal terms increased by only 4.8

per cent to Rs. 1,920.0 billion in 2018 from Rs.

1,831.5 billion recorded in the previous year,

supported by the nominal increase in the revenue

from income taxes, tobacco and cigarettes, VAT

and Ports and Airports Development Levy (PAL).

The revenue collection from import duties, excise

duty on petroleum products, withholding tax and

Cess levy declined by 28.9 per cent, 10.4 per cent,

13.0 per cent and 10.4 per cent, respectively, in

2018 compared to 2017. Non tax revenue as a

percentage of GDP increased to 1.4 per cent

in 2018 from 1.2 per cent in 2017 owing to profit

transfers by the Central Bank and the increase in

revenue from fees and charges.

Total expenditure and net lending during

2018 declined to 18.6 per cent of GDP from

19.2 per cent in 2017, due to the decline in

capital expenditure and net lending. Recurrent

expenditure as a percentage of GDP increased

marginally to 14.5 per cent in 2018, from 14.4 per

cent in 2017, and recorded a nominal increase of

8.4 per cent to Rs. 2,089.7 billion in 2018, from Rs.

1,927.7 billion in 2017. Total interest expenditure,

in nominal terms, increased by 15.9 per cent to

Rs. 852.2 billion in 2018, from Rs. 735.6 billion

in 2017, while expenditure on foreign interest

payments increased by 29.0 per cent to Rs. 212.7

billion in 2018, reflecting the effects of exchange

rate variations and the rise in global interest rates.

Capital expenditure and net lending declined by 6.5

per cent in nominal terms to Rs. 603.5 billion during

the year in comparison to Rs. 645.4 billion in 2017.

Accordingly, capital expenditure and net lending

as a percentage of GDP also declined to 4.2 per

cent in 2018 from 4.8 per cent in 2017. As a result,

public investment declined to 4.3 per cent of GDP

(Rs. 625.0 billion) in 2018 from 4.9 per cent of GDP

(Rs. 657.4 billion) in the previous year.

More than half of the budget deficit for 2018

was financed through domestic sources. In

total financing of the budget deficit, 57.5 per cent

was sourced domestically, while the balance was

met from foreign sources in 2018. The government

relied mainly on domestic non bank sources in 2018,

accounting for 75.0 per cent (Rs. 327.8 billion) of total

net domestic financing compared to 36.2 per cent

(Rs. 106.5 billion) in 2017. As a result, borrowings

from the banking sector declined significantly to Rs.

109.5 billion (25.0 per cent) in 2018, from Rs. 187.7

billion (63.8 per cent) in 2017. During 2018, financing

from commercial banks recorded a net repayment

of Rs. 136.6 billion compared to borrowings of Rs.

375.7 billion in 2017, owing to higher net repayments

of Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) and

Treasury bonds. However, borrowings from the

Central Bank increased notably to Rs. 246.1 billion

in 2018, from a net repayment of Rs. 187.9 billion in

2017 due to increased purchases of Treasury bills

by the Central Bank mainly as a result of the tight

liquidity conditions in the domestic money market.

Foreign financing of the budget deficit declined

to Rs. 323.5 billion in 2018, in comparison to Rs.

439.2 billion in 2017, partly reflecting the impact

of significant outflows from the foreign holdings of

rupee denominated Treasury bonds and Treasury

bills, which amounted to Rs. 141.1 billion during

the year. Net borrowings through ISBs amounted

to Rs. 390.4 billion (US dollars 2.5 billion) in 2018.

Meanwhile, net borrowings through the FCTFF and

foreign project loans amounted to Rs. 66.6 billion

and Rs. 7.7 billion, respectively, in 2018.

Central government debt as a percentage

of GDP increased to 82.9 per cent by end 2018

from 76.9 per cent at end 2017. The increase

in the debt to GDP ratio in 2018 was a combined

outcome of the impact of the depreciation of the

rupee against major foreign currencies, relatively

low nominal GDP and net borrowings to finance the

budget deficit. In nominal terms, central government

debt increased to Rs. 11,977.5 billion by end 2018

from Rs. 10,313.0 billion at end 2017. Of this, total

outstanding domestic debt increased by 7.6 per cent

to Rs. 6,018.0 billion, while the rupee value of total

outstanding foreign debt increased substantially by

26.3 per cent to Rs. 5,959.5 billion by end 2018.

Although the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee

is reflected as an increase in the government

foreign currency debt stock in rupee terms, the

debt stock denominated in foreign currency would

remain unchanged in terms of foreign currency. As

the debt denominated in foreign currency would

be serviced using foreign currency inflows to the

government, the impact of such a nominal increase

in the outstanding balance due to the depreciation

of the rupee would not matter for debt servicing,

provided the confidence of foreign creditors and

investors is maintained to attract sufficient inflows.

Since the average interest rate on foreign currency

debt is much lower than that on rupee denominated

debt, this interest rate differential would largely

Monetary Sector Developments

With the realisation of the objective of the

tight monetary policy stance that was in place

since end 2015, the Central Bank signalled an

end to the monetary tightening cycle in April

2018 and maintained a neutral monetary policy

stance thereafter. Favourable developments

in inflation, inflation outlook as well as subpar

performance in the real economy encouraged the

Central Bank to reduce its policy rates in April

2018. Accordingly, the Central Bank reduced the

Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) by 25 basis

points to 8.50 per cent in April 2018, thus narrowing

the policy rate corridor to 125 basis points. In view

of the developments in the global economy amidst

measures by the US Federal Reserve to continue

its stance on monetary policy normalisation and its

impact on the stability of the external sector of the

domestic economy, the Central Bank maintained

a neutral monetary policy stance since April

2018. The large and persistent liquidity deficit in

the domestic money market, particularly since

September 2018, required policy intervention by

the Central Bank. Accordingly, in order to inject

liquidity on a permanent basis, the Statutory

Reserve Ratio (SRR) applicable on all rupee

deposit liabilities of commercial banks was reduced

by 1.50 percentage points to 6.00 per cent in mid-

November 2018. Nevertheless, to neutralise the

impact of this SRR reduction, the Standing Deposit

Facility Rate (SDFR) was increased by 75 basis

points and SLFR was increased by 50 basis points

further narrowing the policy rate corridor. Despite

the liquidity injection in November 2018, the liquidity

deficit in the domestic money market continued to

persist at high levels. Accordingly, the SRR was

reduced by a further 1.00 percentage point to 5.00

per cent with effect from 01 March 2019, while

maintaining SDFR and SLFR unchanged at 8.00

per cent and 9.00 per cent, respectively.

Amidst tight liquidity conditions and the tight

monetary policy stance that was maintained

until April 2018, most market lending and

deposit interest rates of commercial banks

remained high in both nominal and real terms

during 2018. While some deposit rates declined

with the policy rate adjustment in April 2018,

most deposit and lending rates of commercial

banks increased in 2018. Accordingly, the

Average Weighted Deposit Rate (AWDR), which

captures the movements in interest rates of all

outstanding interest bearing rupee deposits held

with commercial banks, decreased to 8.81 per

cent by end 2018 from 9.07 per cent recorded

at end 2017. Tight liquidity conditions amidst

continued high demand for credit caused lending

rates of commercial banks to remain high in 2018.

Accordingly, the Average Weighted Lending Rate

(AWLR), which is based on interest rates of all

outstanding loans and advances extended by

commercial banks, increased to 14.40 per cent

by end 2018 from 13.88 at end 2017. Meanwhile,

yields on government securities, which showed

mixed movements during the first nine months of

2018, increased notably during the last quarter of

2018, reflecting changes in market sentiments as

well as the funding requirement of the government

amidst tight liquidity conditions. Accordingly, in

2018, primary market yields on the 91-day, 182-

day and 364-day Treasury bills increased by 232,

169 and 230 basis points, respectively. Moreover,

yields on Treasury bonds in the primary market

also displayed mixed movements during 2018.

The secondary market yield curve for government

securities shifted upwards during 2018. Despite

some moderation, interest rates applicable on

corporate debt securities remained high during the

year. In the meantime, interest rates applicable

on foreign currency deposits maintained with

commercial banks showed mixed movements

amidst increasing interest rates in global markets.

Meanwhile, as a result of improved sentiments and

in response to the Central Bank’s action to ease the

liquidity shortage in the domestic money market,

along with the issuance of ISBs in March 2019,

some downward shift in the secondary market

yield curve of government securities as well as a

decline in primary market yields were observed

in early 2019. Bank lending and deposit rates are

yet to respond to monetary policy adjustments and

the declining yields on benchmark government

securities.

Reserve money recorded a moderate growth

during 2018, particularly in the latter part of

the year, with the downward adjustment in

the SRR in November 2018. In absolute terms,

reserve money increased by only Rs. 21.3 billion

to Rs. 961.1 billion during 2018, compared to the

expansion of Rs. 83.6 billion in 2017. In terms of

liabilities, the increase in currency in circulation

contributed entirely to the expansion of reserve

money while commercial banks’ reserve balances

with the Central Bank declined during 2018 as

the SRR was reduced in November 2018. From

the assets side, the expansion of reserve money

during 2018 was driven entirely by the increase

in net domestic assets (NDA) of the Central

Bank. The expansion in NDA of the Central Bank

was the result of a significant expansion in credit

extended to the government on a net basis (NCG)

by the Central Bank, reflecting an increase in the

Treasury bill holdings of the Central Bank. Treasury

bill holdings of the Central Bank (net of repurchase

transactions), which contracted by Rs. 304.5 billion

to Rs. 25.6 billion by end 2017, increased notably

by Rs. 247.4 billion to Rs. 273.0 billion by end

2018. This was mainly due to term and outright

purchases of government securities by the Central

Bank from the market in order to inject liquidity to

the domestic money market. However, in contrast

to the increase in NDA, net foreign assets (NFA)

of the Central Bank declined by Rs. 95.6 billion in

2018, compared to the sharp increase of Rs. 287.5

billion in the previous year. The decline in NFA

was a result of the increase in foreign liabilities,

particularly with international organisations and the

supply of foreign exchange to the domestic market

by the Central Bank during the year.

Broad money (M2b) growth, which gradually

moderated since late 2017, maintained its

decelerating trend throughout the year, largely

on account of the contraction in NFA of the

banking system. M2b growth decelerated to 13.0

per cent, year-on-year, by end 2018, from 16.7

per cent at end 2017. Broad money growth during

2018 was entirely due to the expansion in NDA

of the banking system, as NFA of the banking

system contracted during the year. NFA of the

banking system declined by Rs. 188.5 billion

during 2018 as a result of the decline in foreign

reserves of the Central Bank and the foreign

currency financial position of commercial banks,

amidst capital outflows and rising pressures on the

exchange rate. Meanwhile, NDA of the banking

20

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

sector expanded significantly by Rs. 1,008.8

billion in 2018, which was mainly attributed to

the considerable increase in credit flows to the

private sector, as well as the surge in credit to the

government and SOBEs during the year. Within

NDA, NCG increased significantly by Rs. 346.7

billion in 2018, compared to Rs. 196.4 billion in

the previous year driven by the expansion in credit

from the Central Bank and commercial banks

during the period under review. Accordingly, NCG

from the Central Bank increased by Rs. 246.3

billion during 2018, in comparison to a significant

contraction of Rs. 187.9 billion in 2017, while

NCG from commercial banks increased by Rs.

100.5 billion during 2018, in comparison to the

significant increase of Rs. 384.3 billion in 2017.

Meanwhile, credit obtained by public corporations

from the banking system expanded by Rs. 218.4

billion in 2018, in comparison to the increase of

Rs. 23.2 billion in 2017.

Credit to the private sector by commercial

banks grew at a slower pace during the first

eight months of 2018 while some acceleration

was witnessed during the last four months of

2018. The year-on-year growth of private sector

credit moderated to 14.3 per cent by end August

2018 from 14.7 per cent at end 2017. However,

private sector credit growth subsequently

accelerated to 15.9 per cent by end 2018 with

private sector borrowings increasing in anticipation

of government and Central Bank policies to curtail

imports as well as the rising import costs with

currency depreciation. In absolute terms, credit to

the private sector expanded by Rs. 762.1 billion

during 2018, compared to the increase of Rs.

613.4 billion in 2017. While credit extended to the

Services sector and Personal Loans and Advances

expanded during 2018, some moderation was

observed in the growth of credit extended to the

Industry sector and the Agriculture and Fishing

sectors. Accordingly, the year-on-year growth of

credit to the Industry sector moderated to 15.3

per cent by end 2018 from 19.6 per cent at end

2017, largely due to the slowdown in credit to

the construction sector. Meanwhile, credit to the

Agriculture and Fishing, and Services sectors grew

by 14.0 per cent and 17.8 per cent, respectively,

by end 2018 in comparison to the growth of 14.1

per cent and 8.3 per cent, respectively, recorded

at end 2017. Personal Loans and Advances also

grew by 20.3 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2018

in comparison to the year-on-year growth of 18.5

per cent at end 2017 on account of the expansion

Financial Sector Developments

The financial sector recorded a moderate

expansion in 2018 amidst challenging market

conditions, both globally and domestically.

The banking sector that dominates the financial

sector recorded a moderate growth in total assets

and maintained its capital and liquidity levels

well above the minimum statutory requirement.

The growth of assets was driven mainly by the

expansion in the loan portfolio, which increased

significantly during the second half of 2018 partly

due to the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee.

The increase in loans accounted for 84.1 per cent

of the asset growth of the banking sector during

2018. Deposits continued to be the main source of

funding representing 72.0 per cent of total liabilities

of the banking sector. The quality of the banking

sector assets deteriorated due to challenging global

and domestic market conditions, as reflected by

the increase in Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratios.

Gross NPL ratio, which recorded a historical low

figure of 2.5 per cent at end 2017, increased to 3.4

per cent by end 2018. Profitability of the banking

sector moderated in 2018, due to the deterioration

in asset quality, rise in operating costs and increase

in taxes. Lower profits of the sector, during 2018,

were reflected by the decline in Return on Assets

(ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE). The Central

Bank continued to introduce prudential policy

measures and regulations to strengthen the safety

and soundness of the banking sector.

The growth of the Licensed Finance

Companies (LFCs) and Specialised Leasing

Companies (SLCs) sector slowed in 2018, with

the decline in credit growth and profitability

during the year. Lending activities of the sector

decelerated mainly due to recent fiscal and

macroprudential policy measures, which were

taken to curtail the imports of motor vehicles

and credit facilities for purchasing vehicles. The

profitability of the sector declined during the year

mainly due to increased funding cost and higher

loan loss provisions made against NPLs. Signs of

stress towards the sector’s profitability during the

year were reflected by the decrease in ROA and

ROE. The Central Bank continued to strengthen

the supervisory and regulatory framework of LFCs

and SLCs and took action to revive or close down

weak LFCs. Other sectors of the financial system,

including superannuation funds, insurance and

primary dealers expanded moderately during 2018.

Nevertheless, a deterioration in the performance of

the Unit Trust sector was recorded during the year.

Rupee liquidity in the domestic money

market, which displayed mixed movements

until mid-September 2018, turned into

persistent deficit levels thereafter mainly due to

foreign exchange related transactions carried

out by the Central Bank. The imposition of the

margin requirement on Letters of Credit (LCs) on

the importation of motor vehicles and the statutory

requirement that such deposits be maintained with

the Central Bank also contributed to the liquidity

deficit to some extent. Although the pressure on

domestic money market eased considerably with

the injection of liquidity by way of the SRR reduction

in November 2018, liquidity in the domestic money

market continued to remain at deficit levels by end

2018 partly due to foreign exchange sales by the

Central Bank. In the domestic foreign exchange

market, the Central Bank intervened to ease the

continued pressure on the exchange rate and curb

the excess volatility arising from substantial capital

outflows and increased import demand, particularly

from May 2018. Meanwhile, the CSE recorded a

dismal performance in 2018, impacted by significant

22

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

foreign outflows driven by increased pressure on

the exchange rate, political uncertainty and the shift

in investor sentiments due to domestic and global

developments. The negative developments were

reflected by the decline in most indicators including

share prices, turnover, market capitalisation and

Price to Earnings (PE) ratios throughout the year.

Meanwhile, the Central Bank further broadened

the regulatory and supervisory activities relating to

payment and settlement systems during the year

with the objective of ensuring safe and efficient

payment and settlement infrastructure required for

households and the corporate sector to facilitate

economic activities.

1.3 Global Economic Environment and Outlook

As per the January 2019 update of the

World Economic Outlook (WEO) of the IMF,

a moderation in the expansion of global

economic activity was observed in 2018, on

account of mounting economic and political

headwinds internationally. Compared to 2017,

global growth was increasingly unsynchronised

during 2018, as most economies, apart from the

US, experienced a slowdown in economic activity.

In spite of the notable growth in economic activity in

the US, growth among advanced economies grew

modestly during 2018, with a larger than expected

moderation in economic activity in the UK, Euro

area and Japan. Meanwhile, emerging market and

developing economies continued to grow strongly,

albeit at a slower pace than in the previous year,

underpinned by improved domestic demand and

higher oil prices favouring oil-exporting economies,

amidst a challenging global macroeconomic

environment driven by rising trade tensions and

tighter financial conditions. Further, the uncertainty

surrounding the Brexit and mounting tensions from

the Sino-American trade war led to a moderation

in global trade during 2018. Meanwhile, oil prices,

which were on an increasing trend during the first

nine months of 2018, caused some acceleration in

inflation in both advanced economies and emerging

market and developing economies during the year.

Amidst mounting uncertainties in the global

economic environment, a gradual approach of

monetary policy normalisation was undertaken

by most advanced economies during 2018,

citing favourable developments in domestic

market conditions, necessitating emerging

market economies to respond with the view of

containing the adverse spillover effects of such

normalisation. The US Federal Reserve, which

commenced tightening monetary policy in late 2015,

tightened its stance further by increasing the Federal

Funds target rate in four instances during 2018,

responding to improved domestic demand and

strengthening labour markets. However, considering

the signals that the US economy is slowing down

while inflationary pressures remain subdued, the

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

Federal Reserve adopted a more cautious approach

from January 2019. Meanwhile, the Bank of England

(BOE) increased its policy rates in August 2018, with

domestic economic activity gathering momentum

and inflation hovering above the targeted levels.

However, the intensification of tensions surrounding

Brexit along with subdued domestic and global

growth caused the BOE to remain increasingly

dovish. With inflation gaining momentum and risks

to the growth outlook remaining broadly balanced,

the European Central Bank (ECB) announced the

gradual winding down of quantitative easing (QE).

Accordingly, by end 2018, the net asset purchases

concluded, although Brexit woes and rising global

risks resulting from escalating trade tensions led

the ECB to continue its accommodative stance

on monetary policy. Having little success on the

achievement of the inflation target, the Bank of Japan

(BOJ) continued with its accommodative monetary

policy stance during 2018. Meanwhile, emerging

market economies were impacted by monetary

policy normalisation measures in key advanced

economies and the ensuing capital outflows as

well as rising trade tensions. In response to these

economic headwinds, a number of central banks in

emerging market economies raised interest rates.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised its interest

rates twice during 2018, which was later reversed

with a policy rate cut in early 2019. The lacklustre

growth and investor confidence, and rising risks

to financial stability required China to ease fiscal

and monetary policies during 2018. As a result of

global economic and financial market developments

and domestic vulnerabilities, currencies of

several emerging market economies depreciated

considerably against the US dollar during 2018.

The balance of risks to global growth, as

highlighted in the January 2019 update of

WEO, is tilted to the downside indicating the

possibility of some slowdown in the global

economy going forward. Central banks in most

advanced, and emerging market and developing

economies have taken measures to tighten

monetary policy during 2018 in view of containing

undue inflationary pressures arising from the

favourable economic outlook, stronger labour

markets and subsequent firming up of demand.

However, with increased uncertainty surrounding

global and domestic macroeconomic developments

and inflationary pressures remaining somewhat

muted, the policy stance of major central banks

turned more accommodative commencing early

2019. Nonetheless, several risks remain that

could weigh down on global growth prospects.

The continuation of the US-China trade tensions

could bring in greater policy uncertainties among

economies and could restrain global trade, thereby

weakening global growth prospects. Also, a

further slowdown in the Chinese economy will

require continued fiscal and monetary stimulus,

failing which the economy could be increasingly

vulnerable to a prolonged downturn. This could

wane demand for commodities leading to a drop

in prices, severely affecting commodity-exporting

economies and global growth at large. The ongoing

uncertainties surrounding Brexit would impede

growth prospects in the UK, Eurozone as well as

in other partner economies. In the meantime, oil

prices are expected to remain subdued, particularly

with a possible supply glut due to US shale

production and lack of cooperation among OPEC

economies. Although moderate oil prices are

expected to reduce global inflationary pressures, oil

exporting economies are expected to be negatively

impacted while oil producing corporates are likely

to experience a thinning of their margins.

Mounting uncertainties in the global political

and economic environment pose significant

challenges to Sri Lanka, necessitating the

implementation of timely and prudent policy

measures to support domestic growth

initiatives while maintaining stability. The

weaker economic outlook reflecting subdued

global demand could impact Sri Lanka’s trade

during 2019. Moreover, escalating trade tensions

between the US and China, as well as the UK and

the Eurozone could exacerbate this impact affecting

the country’s BOP. However, this impact could

ease somewhat with key economies increasingly

adopting accommodative monetary policies to

stimulate domestic demand. Nevertheless, any rise

in global market interest rates could increase debt

servicing costs of the government and corporates,

leading to greater financial fragility and weaker

risk profile of the country. Therefore, prudent

accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and

careful management of external debt are essential

in the period ahead. As global oil prices are

expected to remain at current subdued levels, its

impact on domestic inflation is expected to remain

minimal during 2019.

1.4 Medium Term Macroeconomic Outlook

The growth momentum of the economy that

has been subdued in recent years is expected

to gradually improve over the medium term.

Real GDP growth, which remained modest at

around 3.2 per cent in 2018, as per the estimates

of the DCS, is projected to gradually improve to

around 5.0 per cent by 2023.1 The achievement

of the envisaged growth path would depend on

the successful implementation of the growth

framework laid out in public policy documents

along with higher participation of the private sector.

The implementation of consistent policy measures

without frequent revisions is expected to attract

investment from both local and foreign sources

1 The medium term growth path is projected based on national accounts compiled by DCS with the base year 2010. Any revisions to past growth rates and to the base year will require a revision to the medium term projections as well.

into more productive sectors in the economy. With

these investments, the output in the manufacturing

sector that has remained modest, is expected

to gradually shift towards higher value added

products that are capable of meeting the demand

of the domestic market as well as accessing

international markets through the effective

exploitation of trade agreements. Meanwhile,

the value added contribution from the services

sector is envisaged to rise with the expansion in

knowledge based services. The efforts towards

developing a commercially viable agriculture sector

would also support the productive allocation of

resources in the economy. Moreover, continued

investment in economic infrastructure would

provide impetus to growth during the medium

term. This would include numerous projects in

energy, public transport, and road development

sectors aimed at supporting the production

capacity of the country. In addition, the successful

completion of development activities taking place

in relation to the Colombo Port City project and

the Western Region Megapolis Master Plan is also

expected to boost economic growth. In tandem

with these developments, education standards in

the country are expected to be enhanced to meet

the demands for a more skilled labour force from

emerging sectors. Moreover, strengthening the

higher education sector to enhance research and

innovation is also expected to contribute towards

sustaining a higher growth path. Implementation

of measures aimed at increasing female labour

force participation would also support the growth

drive.2 These developments together with policies

aimed at maintaining a stable macroeconomic

environment are expected to improve Sri Lanka’s

per capita GDP to over US dollars 5,000 by 2023.

2 The ageing of the population leading to the end of the demographic dividend means that growth can no longer be driven by labour augmentation derived from a rising population. It would need to be supported by higher productivity and in-creased female labour force participation, which is currently at around 34 per cent.

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

The outlook for the external sector, which

improved since the latter part of 2018, is

expected to remain resilient despite potential

downside risks over the medium term. Exports

are projected to improve with the support of a

flexible and competitive exchange rate, envisaged

economic growth in Sri Lanka’s export destinations,

the establishment of bilateral trade agreements and

the implementation of the National Export Strategy

(NES). Imports are also projected to increase

moderately over the medium term with higher

imports of intermediate and investment goods

supporting the medium term growth trajectory.

Meanwhile, the surplus in the services account is

expected to improve with higher inflows, particularly

on account of tourism, Information Technology (IT),

Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and transport

services. Tourist earnings are expected to increase

over the medium term with the projected increase

in arrivals, the development of new star class

hotels and aggressive promotional campaigns. The

IT related exports are expected to continue their

robust growth while earnings from transportation

are expected to rise with the enhanced external

trade, accelerated development in the Hambantota

port and further growth in activities in the Colombo

port. Workers’ remittances are expected to remain

at current levels over the medium term due to the

possible slowdown in labour migration given the

improved domestic employment opportunities,

and initiatives aimed at discouraging semi-skilled

and unskilled migration together with unfavourable

geopolitical developments in the Middle East.

Meanwhile, the deficit in the primary income

account is expected to widen over the medium

term with higher interest payments amidst rising

global interest rates. However, the combined effect

of these developments is expected to result in

an improvement in the external current account

deficit over the medium term to a sustainable

level. Meanwhile, the financial account of the BOP

is expected to improve with higher FDI inflows,

particularly with the long term development

projects in the Colombo Port City and Hambantota

industrial zone as well as FDI expected through

Private Public Partnership (PPP) initiatives of the

government. Further, foreign investments to the

CSE and the government securities market are

also expected to stabilise with the perceived delay

in interest rate hikes in international markets. In

addition, the extension of the IMF-EFF programme

is expected to contribute towards improving the

external sector outlook, thereby bolstering investor

sentiment. Amidst the expected adjustment in the

current account deficit and the gradual reduction

in the reliance on debt related inflows, a flexible

and competitive exchange rate is expected to be

maintained within the envisaged flexible inflation

targeting regime. This would also contribute to

reinforce international reserves while reserve

adequacy is expected to remain at satisfactory

levels over the medium term. Further, the

successful implementation of the provisions in the

Active Liability Management Act No. 08 of 2018

(ALMA) and the Medium Term Debt Management

Strategy (MTDS) of the government is expected to

address potential vulnerabilities associated with

refinancing requirements arising from bunching of

foreign currency debt service payments, including

the future maturities of ISBs. Meanwhile, the

financial position of commercial banks is also

expected to strengthen with the expected gradual

improvement of liquidity in the domestic foreign

exchange market.

The priority of the government’s fiscal

strategy is to reduce the budget deficit

and thereby the outstanding debt to a

sustainable level over the medium term with

the continuation of the revenue based fiscal

consolidation measures. Government revenue

is expected to increase to around 17 per cent of

GDP by 2023, supported by policy measures to

broaden the tax base, simplify the tax legislation

and improve the tax administration. Further, the

government intends to rationalise the expenditure

by imposing ceilings and improving efficiency in

public financial management over the medium

term. The continuation of social safety nets with

improved targeting through the Welfare Benefits

Board, implementation of contingent budgeting

and strengthening the insurance scheme for

managing fiscal costs on natural disasters together

with the ongoing progress of the rationalisation of

recurrent expenditure would support the envisaged

expenditure management, while maintaining the

total expenditure at around 20 per cent of GDP in

the medium term. Consequently, the budget deficit

is expected to record a deficit of 3.5 per cent of

GDP in 2020 and 3.2 per cent of GDP by 2023.

The government’s fiscal strategy would strengthen

the primary balance in the medium term assisted

by improved government revenue and expenditure

management. Thus, the primary balance of the

government is expected to record a surplus of 2.8

per cent of GDP by 2023. In addition, the current

account is also envisaged to record a surplus in

2019 and remain in surplus thereafter. With the

anticipated improvement in the budget deficit

and the primary balance, the outstanding central

27

government debt to GDP ratio is expected to

decline to around 70 per cent of GDP by 2023. The

achievement of the above medium term targets

would be a challenging task, and the successful

implementation requires a strong commitment and

dedication by all stakeholders of the government.

Meanwhile, the successful implementation of

the provisions in the ALMA and the MTDS are

expected to further improve and strengthen the

debt management strategy over the medium term.

Building on the envisaged fiscal consolidation

over the medium term, the government is

expected to elevate public investment to 5.5 per

cent of GDP, thereby supporting the medium

term growth prospects of the economy. Further,

proper implementation of fiscal rules, with

necessary amendments to the Fiscal Management

(Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003, would ensure

the achievement of the expected improvements in

the fiscal sector with improved fiscal discipline.

Inflation expectations are likely to be

anchored more firmly at mid single digit levels

in the medium term under the envisaged

flexible inflation targeting regime. Monetary

policy decisions made in an increasingly

forward looking and data driven framework

are expected to maintain aggregate demand

conditions at appropriate levels, in spite of the

risks to inflation arising from global and domestic

macroeconomic developments. On the global

front, supply disruptions, particularly in relation to

energy prices, could exert pressure on inflation

periodically, while volatility in domestic food

supplies could threaten the achievement of

inflation targets unless domestic supply conditions

are improved and short term fiscal adjustments

are made proactively to address such concerns.

In the meantime, adhering to the envisaged fiscal

consolidation path is required in order to sustain

inflation at desired levels. While monetary policy

decisions are expected to be responsive to demand

driven inflation and the output gap, the flexible

exchange rate policy will allow the exchange rate

to be determined by market fundamentals and act

as the first line of defense to dampen the impact

of external shocks. Further, the Central Bank

would ensure sufficient money and credit flows to

support the expected growth of economic activity,

and accordingly, broad money supply (M2b) and

credit to the private sector are projected to grow

annually by around 12.5 per cent and 13.5 per

cent, respectively, over the medium term.

1.5 Issues and Policies

Amidst efforts to maintain the country’s

macroeconomic stability over the past several

years, the postponement of much needed

structural reforms has moved the Sri Lankan

economy to a modest growth path. Sri Lanka’s

graduation to the middle income status almost a

decade ago required far reaching policy reforms

to move towards higher income status by avoiding

the so-called middle income trap. However, delays

in addressing barriers to growth and introducing

growth enhancing reforms in the areas of export

promotion, attracting FDI, reducing budget

deficits and debt levels, reforming factor markets,

strengthening public administration, and ensuring

the rule of law have largely contributed to Sri Lanka’s

economic stagnation, while peer economies have

progressed rapidly as a result of growth supporting

reforms. Therefore, for Sri Lanka to succeed as a

higher income economy and improve the wellbeing

of its people, it is essential that the root causes for

the continued low economic growth are addressed

by expediting the required structural reforms with

a focus on improving productivity and efficiency

of the economy. The end of the demographic

dividend reinforces the need for this.

28

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Sri Lanka is endowed with plenty of natural

resources with potential to support a high

economic growth path, if utilised efficiently.

As an island nation in the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka

has numerous ocean resources. However, local

consumers still consume imported canned fish

and this reflects the strong need for supporting the

fisheries sector. Common salt extracted from sea

water is used to produce a number of industrial

raw materials, including Caustic Soda, Chlorine,

Hydrochloric acid, Sodium Carbonate, Sodium

Bicarbonate, Bleaching Powder, Poly Vinyl Chloride

(PVC), etc. Sri Lanka, however, spends a substantial

amount of foreign exchange in importing these raw

materials at present. Sri Lanka, compared to its

size, has many minerals that are essential for state-

of-the-art technologies. Although the presence of

mineral sands in Sri Lanka was discovered in 1904

and the industry dates back to the 1950s, there has

been no significant value addition to commercially

viable minerals such as ilmenite, rutile and zircon

during the past six decades. Further, the phosphate

deposit in Eppawela, which can be used in the

manufacturing of fertiliser as well as other industrial

inputs is clearly underutilised. Hence, implementing

an integrated national policy to facilitate value

addition of minerals is a priority that would contribute

to enhancing export earnings while creating new

job opportunities. In addition, the ongoing efforts to

exploit the potential to produce graphene, which is

used in the production of solar cells, LEDs, touch

panels and batteries, etc. using Sri Lankan graphite

should be fast-tracked. Moreover, petroleum

exploration in Sri Lanka began in the late 1960s

and, in the recent past, several leading international

petroleum companies have shown interest to

explore oil and gas in Sri Lankan waters. Against

the backdrop of Sri Lanka’s total dependence on

imported petroleum and the government plans to

shift Sri Lanka’s power plants towards natural gas,

it is essential to continue the efforts on oil and gas

exploration as the benefits of finding commercially

viable petroleum deposits could be much larger

than the associated costs. Moreover, Sri Lanka

is historically gifted with a hydraulic civilisation

driven by a rich irrigation tradition. In fact, the Sri

Lankan agrarian system, the “ellanga gammana”

or Cascaded Tank-Village system in the dry zone,

was designated as a Globally Important Agricultural

Heritage System by the Food and Agriculture

Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in 2018. In

spite of this rich heritage, inadequate water resource

management policies and delays in the enforcement

of existing regulations have resulted in complex

issues, including the depletion and degradation of

water resources due to contamination with domestic

sewage, industrial waste and agricultural residuals,

biological contamination of ground water as well as

over-utilisation of water, particularly through tube

wells. In spite of numerous government initiatives,

little or no progress has been made towards

the effective management of natural resources

in the country over the past several decades,

and accordingly, more focused, proactive, policy

initiatives which could also harness the support of the

private sector are crucial to tap the full potential of Sri

Lanka’s natural resources in a sustainable manner.

In spite of some progress in relation to a few

products in recent times, Sri Lanka’s merchandise

exports sector requires greater efforts to address

the rapid decline in its share in the domestic

economy as well as within global trade. The

growth of merchandise exports has slowed down

substantially over the past two decades, although

services exports showed a notable growth during

this period. The slowdown in merchandise

exports has widened the current account deficit,

requiring the country to increasingly rely on foreign

borrowings to finance this deficit. Poor performance

in merchandise exports could be attributed to

several structural issues in the economy such as

The Need for a National Strategy for Exports

Exports play an important role in an economy affecting the balance of payments, including the capacity to service external debt, economic growth and employment. Sri Lanka adopted an export led growth strategy when economic liberalisation policies were introduced in 1977. However, the country has been unable to maintain a sustained growth in exports despite measures taken by successive governments for export promotion. Sri Lanka’s exports as a share of GDP have declined drastically from 33.3 per cent in 2000 to 13.4 per cent in 2018. In fact, Sri Lanka’s annual average export growth has declined to 5.6 per cent during the period 2000-2018 from 10.7 per cent during 1977-2000. In line with this, Sri Lanka’s exports as a share of world exports declined from 0.086 per cent in 2000 to 0.064 per cent in 2017. Although earnings from exports have recovered slightly since 2017, Sri Lanka has lagged behind in terms of its export performance in comparison to the rest of the world, particularly regional peers such as Vietnam, Cambodia, India, and Bangladesh who have recorded average export growth rates of 18.1 per cent, 14.7 per cent, 13.7 per cent and 11.4 per cent, respectively, during the period 2000-2017. The lack of coordinated export promotion policies and strategies has been a key reason for the dismal export performance. An attempt was made in 2004 to produce a National Export Strategy (NES) for Sri Lanka (NES 2004-2008), but its ineffective implementation failed to deliver the intended outcomes. It was evident that for the export sector to emerge as a key driver of economic growth, formulating a strategic plan to drive the export sector within the overall development strategy of the government is important. Accordingly, export sector stakeholders have highlighted the need for a National Export Strategy, which would be implemented over a sustained period in order to achieve the export targets identified in the strategy. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), in its Annual Report for 2016 also underscored the importance of a NES for Sri Lanka (Box 07: National Strategy towards Export Promotion).

Against this backdrop, the government, under the initiative of the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade (MODSIT) and the Export Development Board (EDB), crafted and launched the NES 2018 – 2022, in July 2018, following a thorough stakeholder consultation process. The technical support in designing the NES 2018 - 2022 was obtained from the International Trade Centre (ITC) within the framework of the EU - Sri Lanka Trade Related Assistance Project funded by the European Union.

BOX 2The National Export Strategy (NES) 2018-2022

The NES 2018 - 2022 at a Glance

The NES is a blueprint intended to be executed within a 5-year horizon from 2018 - 2022 to fast track Sri Lanka’s export growth, harnessing the capabilities and resources of the country to achieve the targets envisaged in the government’s Vision 2025 policy document and the New Trade Policy (NTP). The NES 2018 - 2022 was designed with a view to transforming Sri Lanka into an export hub driven by innovation and investment, based on four strategic objectives as illustrated in Figure B 2.1. In addition, it aims to improve the business environment for all export sectors based on four cross-cutting Trade Support Functions (TSFs). These TSFs include logistics, trade information and promotion, national quality infrastructure and innovation and entrepreneurship. The development of the identified TSFs would help overcome main challenges in the provision of quality and affordable support services to Sri Lankan exporters. Meanwhile, the NES 2018 - 2022 highlights six focus sectors for innovation and export diversification, namely; information technology and business process management (IT-BPM), wellness tourism, boat building, electrical and electronic components, processed food and beverages, and spices and concentrates, while supporting the growth of traditional export industries.

The six focus sectors were identified based on quantitative and qualitative parameters derived from export potential assessments conducted by the EDB and the Board of Investments (BOI) under the guidance of Harvard University, in collaboration with the Commonwealth Secretariat, McKinsey Consultants, the World Bank and the ITC. Focus sectors cover all

major economic sectors, namely, agriculture, industry and services and are at different stages of growth where their growth trends have been classified as mature, emerging and visionary (Table B 2.1). Sectors such as IT-BPM and spices and concentrates are considered as mature sectors that have a high potential for increased export revenue. For instance, in 2018, about 80,000 professionals were employed in the IT-BPM sector, contributing 10.1 per cent to total services exports of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is also well known for its spices and extracts or concentrates due to their unique qualities, yet the sector contributed only 3 per cent, in 2018, to total merchandise exports in spite of Sri Lanka being the largest global supplier of cinnamon with a market share of 30 per cent in global cinnamon exports. Wellness tourism and processed foods and beverages were identified as emerging focus sectors where growing ayurvedic health services and unique food and beverage blends with Sri Lankan spices would create a large potential for export earning opportunities for Sri Lanka. The boating industry and the electrical and electronic component sectors were considered as visionary focus sectors, which could benefit from Sri Lanka’s strategic location while enhancing the country’s potential for participation in product sharing networks. All six focus sectors feature a competitive advantage for Sri Lanka through its unique location, the skilled workforce, the long history and rich culture and the tropical climate that feeds biodiversity and the agricultural base.

The Plan of Actions and Effective Monitoring of NES Implementation

The NES contains a comprehensive Plan of Actions (PoAs) which translates priorities into actions to be implemented during the period 2018-2022.

The responsibility of implementing PoAs has been assigned to national institutions identified as leading and supporting institutions, where the former would coordinate the implementation of the PoAs with the help of the latter. The effective implementation of the PoAs is key to the success of the NES 2018-2022, given the experience of the previous NES. Therefore, the success of the NES 2018-2022 would depend on the commitment, willingness and capacity of all stakeholders to contribute, collaborate, own and drive PoAs towards a common national objective. A management and coordination mechanism has been inbuilt in the NES 2018-2022 under the MODSIT, consisting of several advisory committees with private and public sector representatives and a management unit empowered with the authority to oversee and coordinate with various entities to carry out PoAs. Accordingly, 16 new advisory committees have been established, covering all major sectors under the purview of the NES 2018-2022, and a review of the progress of implementation of the PoAs has commenced.

Expectations of the NES 2018 - 2022

The NES is expected to create steady and sustainable growth in exports for the benefit of all Sri Lankans. The NES would unlock nascent export sectors to create new job opportunities, while facilitating value addition through increased participation in global value chains and product sharing networks. TSFs are expected to ease barriers for start-ups to enter into the export sector, especially for SMEs, while attracting new investments by streamlining legal and administrative procedures. Overall, the NES would support export led growth on a sustained basis over the medium term. A transformation in export performance is also essential to service the onerous debt servicing burden, while supporting the country’s import requirements and maintaining a level of external reserves which provides sufficient confidence to foreign investors and creditors.

In conclusion, the NES 2018-2022 is a comprehensive national strategy designed in line with international best practices to address the needs of the Sri Lanka's lagging export sector with a view to uplifting its competitiveness in a sustainable manner. The success of the strategy depends on the effective implementation of the proposed actions within the specified time period. Therefore, a coordinated effort is required for the successful implementation of this nationally important strategy to reap the intended benefits for the betterment of the country.

limited product and market diversification, lack

of competitiveness, misaligned exchange rate at

times, para-tariffs which impede access to global

and regional supply chains, absence of sufficient

innovation and research and development (R&D)

and inability to gain economies of scale. In this

backdrop, export promotion strategies should be

focused on the overall economy while encouraging

selected sectors with identified potential. Regional

peers, such as South Korea and Vietnam,

have achieved a significant boost in exports

by following a holistic approach towards export

promotion. In this regard, several policy measures

have already been taken by the government to

address some of the identified issues in the export

sector. New Trade Policy (NTP) and NES, which

urge overall economic reforms, were the most

recently introduced landmark measures. NTP

aims at improving competitiveness of both goods

and services sectors through domestic policy

reforms, including rationalisation of tariffs and

para-tariffs, non-tariff barriers and liberalising the

services sector, while establishing appropriate

legal mechanisms, standards, regulations and

safeguards. NES focuses on trade promotion,

export finance and streamlining the institutional

and regulatory framework. The generation of higher

export revenues will serve as a buffer against rising

foreign liabilities, help stabilise the exchange rate

and support building up of international reserves

to improve the country’s economic resilience while

supporting economic growth. Growth in exports

also entails several other benefits such as inflow of

FDI and new technology, higher value employment

opportunities, greater economies of scale, and

increased overall productivity and competitiveness

of the country.

The potential of the tourism industry to

become the highest foreign exchange earner

in Sri Lanka must be supported by addressing

barriers to its further growth. Sri Lanka has

positioned itself as one of the best tourist destinations

in the region with an annual average growth of

tourist arrivals of over 20 per cent during the post

conflict era compared to the low growth of around

one per cent during 2000-2009. Further, during the

post conflict period, the average daily spending by

tourists has increased substantially while average

duration of stay has also increased. Despite these

recent developments, Sri Lanka has not reached

its potential, compared to the other countries in the

region, such as Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia.

The government has introduced a comprehensive

Tourism Strategic Plan (TSP) 2017-2020 identifying

issues and policy reforms towards achieving a

medium term target of US dollars 7 billion tourist

earnings by 2020. However, in order to increase

the sustainability of the tourism sector and improve

earnings, further enhancements are required. Sri

Lanka has many diverse attractions spread all over

the island, but there is no balanced or smooth flow

of visitors to them, which disturbs the attractions as

well as tourists. Therefore, a coordinated effort is

needed among tourist service providers and related

organisations to spread out tourist visits over the

attractions and time periods. Providing facilities for

advance online ticket booking with peak and off

peak pricing, online information on crowd pressure,

weather conditions and public transport systems

would be able to ease the pressure on currently

overcrowded attractions, such as Sigiriya, and

national parks, such as Horton plains, Yala and

Udawalawe. Further, improving public amenities

at attractions, increasing accessible time and

enabling night time visits, would support the tourism

industry. To prevent disturbances to animals as

well as tourists and to be more environmental

friendly, possibilities could be explored to occupy

electric powered vehicles for safaris instead of

individual fuel powered noisy safari jeeps. Further,

Sri Lanka lacks tourist facilities and attractions

32

that can handle a large number of tourists, such

as cable car systems, theme parks, cruises, scenic

train rides and coordinated tourism zones. GPS

enabled self-guiding multi-lingual mobile devices

can be provided at key tourist attractions such as

Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Sigiriya, as well

as for Colombo city tours. In addition, as the Port

City Project develops, a surge in business and MICE

(Meetings, Incentives, Conventions, Exhibitions)

visitors, who generally have short travel plans,

could be expected, and the specific needs of such

tourists must be met through advanced planning.

Further, Sri Lanka needs to increase its capacity

and the quality of airports as tourists form their first

impression of the country at the entry point. At the

same time, development of seaports is essential to

cater to cruise liners. Further, stopover packages

can be designed to attract transit passengers

at air and seaports to spend a short stay in Sri

Lanka. Improving Sri Lanka’s greenery, air quality

and biodiversity would attract more tourists.

Government farms, which are scattered around

the country, can be utilised for agro tourism as Sri

Lanka is blessed with unique agro techniques and

a wide variety of crops. In order to implement plans

to promote tourism, private sector participation can

be encouraged through PPP, allowing Sri Lanka

to achieve the untapped potential of the tourism

industry.

While measures are taken to attract increased

FDI inflows, it is necessary to ensure that such

inflows are routed to productive sectors that

can support sustained economic growth. During

recent years, although FDI inflows have been on the

rise, these inflows have contributed little towards

enhancing export competitiveness and stimulating

economic growth as a result of such investments

being largely concentrated in non-tradable sectors.

Sri Lanka still lags behind its regional counterparts

in attracting FDI, particularly to sectors that enable

manufacturers to integrate into high value added

global production networks, which could also bring

along technological know-how related to the high-

tech manufacturing industry. In contrast, other

emerging market economies in the Asian region,

such as Vietnam, have been extremely successful

in attracting impressive levels of FDI over the

years, with such investments being mainly received

by processing and manufacturing industries that

account for half the value of industrial production in

Vietnam. Moreover, Vietnam’s FDI strategy focuses

on increased foreign investment in high-tech

industries, rather than labour-intensive sectors.

Vietnam’s success can be mainly attributed to the

country’s sociopolitical stability, the government’s

commitment to create a fair and attractive business

environment for foreign investors while constantly

improving its legal framework and institutions related

to business and investment. Reforms introduced

by the Vietnamese government to improve the

investment climate have led Vietnam to be placed

69th in the “Ease of Doing Business Ranking -

2019” published by the World Bank, whereas Sri

Lanka, although recording an improvement from

the previous year, was ranked in the 100th position

among 190 countries, mainly due to cumbersome

business regulatory structures related to business

start-up, enforcement of contracts, property

registration, paying taxes and obtaining credit.

Moreover, a weak institutional environment, rigid

labour markets and less developed infrastructure

have been identified as deterrents that have

caused Sri Lanka to slip in the ranking by 4 notches

over the preceding year to the 85th place among

140 countries in the “Global Competitiveness

Index 2018” published by the World Economic

Forum. Therefore, robust policy initiatives must

be implemented urgently to overcome these

concerns that undermine an investor friendly

environment. Furthermore, Sri Lanka needs to

develop a well-articulated and coherent investment

33

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

policy clarifying how the country can use FDI to

achieve the development goals of the country while

focusing on how to better attract efficiency seeking

FDI as well as enhance market seeking investment

in export oriented industries in which Sri Lanka

possesses a higher competitive advantage. A

targeted approach is required to attract foreign

investors who would not only bring in capital but

also support the country to integrate with global

value chains through their established networks

while facilitating the domestic manufacturing sector

by utilising the country’s natural resources and pool

of skilled labour. Moreover, measures should be

taken to eradicate corruption, enhance institutional

alignment and regulatory coherence by forging

linkages between government institutions, and

improve logistics for trade facilitation and expedite

labour market reforms in order to foster investor

confidence. Most importantly, financing the current

account deficit through increased non debt creating

flows in the form of FDI is essential as a sustainable

solution in addressing Sri Lanka’s weak external

sector and enhancing resilience against external

vulnerabilities.

While taking measures to strengthen the

external sector resilience by attracting non-debt

creating foreign exchange inflows, the medium

term challenge of overcoming the bunching

of foreign debt service payments must be met

in order to prevent major disruptions to the

macroeconomic balance. During the last decade,

a major contributor to the country’s external sector

imbalances has been the mounting external

debt and external debt service payments. With

annual external debt repayment commitments of

over US dollars 5 billion on average, Sri Lanka

faces heightened refinancing risks. The situation

is further exacerbated by the limited availability

of concessional foreign financing, following Sri

Lanka’s transition to a middle income economy.

This has resulted in an increase in the country’s

dependence on market based foreign borrowings

and such borrowings have increased the country’s

exposure and vulnerability to tightening global

financial conditions. Moreover, Sri Lanka, being a

twin deficit country with persistently high budget and

external current account deficits, has been relying

on domestic and foreign borrowings to finance

these deficits over the years. Large fiscal deficits

have resulted in a mounting external debt stock of

Sri Lanka. In addition, the widening current account

deficits have also led to an increased reliance

on unsustainable levels of foreign borrowings

to finance such deficits. These borrowings will

increase associated interest payments, thereby

contributing to widen the deficit in the current

account in a vicious cycle. On the other hand,

the increased foreign debt service payments will

drain the country’s international reserves, which

serves as a buffer for external shocks. Even with

an effective liability management framework and

continued fiscal consolidation, the solution to

addressing persistent issues in the external sector

lies in resolving the current account deficit through

encouraging the production economy and export of

merchandise goods and services, while creating an

investor friendly environment to attract higher FDI

inflows.

Although notable progress is made in

the process of fiscal consolidation and in

implementing fiscal reforms, further efforts are

necessary to address the lingering concerns

in public finance. Lower than expected revenue

mobilisation is a chronic issue in the fiscal

operations in Sri Lanka. Although the enactment

of the Inland Revenue Act and the introduction

of electronic systems for revenue management

are likely to help enhance revenue, the delays in

implementing revenue enhancement measures

and leakages due to tax evasion and tax avoidance

34

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

1

need to be addressed if the envisaged fiscal

targets are to be achieved. Despite the substantial

increase in the number of tax files in the Inland

Revenue Department (IRD) in the recent past,

such an increase has not been fully translated into

a rise in income tax collection and therefore the

direct to indirect tax ratio still remains weak. Proper

implementation of tax revenue enhancement

measures, close and efficient monitoring of

compliance, further simplification and streamlining

of the tax structure, improving public awareness

on tax obligations and tax payment procedures are

among the actions that need to be taken without

delay in this regard. Meanwhile, in response to the

constrained fiscal space and the need to persist

with the fiscal consolidation path, a reduction

in capital expenditure, relating predominantly

to economic and social infrastructure, was

also observed in recent years. This is counter-

productive and will dampen economic growth over

the medium to long term. Curtailing and delaying

much needed public capital expenditure to offset

overruns in recurrent expenditure is undesirable,

especially in an environment where a lack of

confidence continues to constrain private capital

investment. Moreover, it is important to avoid

expansionary fiscal operations, particularly those

of a recurrent nature, amidst rising debt levels

and debt servicing requirements, as this would

escalate macroeconomic imbalances. Against this

backdrop, implementation of legally binding fiscal

rules and commitment to a fiscal consolidation

programme that allows the maintenance of a level

of capital expenditure aligned with absorptive

capacity are, therefore, imperative to reinforce

fiscal sustainability in Sri Lanka.

The energy infrastructure of the country

needs to progress in tandem with the envisaged

growth path in order to prevent undue

bottlenecks to growth. The country’s energy

requirement would grow rapidly in an environment

of urbanisation, increasing economic activity, and

in view of the planned mega projects, such as the

Port City, industrial zones and the Western Region

Megapolis project. This is evidenced by an over 50

per cent increase in electricity generation to meet

the rising demand during the past decade, while

achieving over 99 per cent electrification in the

country. However, amidst the rising demand, cost

of energy has risen in the backdrop of increased

reliance on external sources as reflected through a

burgeoning annual petroleum bill. Moreover, losses

made by the major SOBEs that provide these

utilities are also a serious cause for concern. While

such losses need to be addressed by the adoption

of cost reflective pricing mechanisms, the rising

energy cost that weighs on the competitiveness of

the domestic tradable sector and increases cost of

living must be proactively addressed by improving

the power sector to meet the growing demand for

electricity. In the meantime, efficient utilisation

of the existing generation capacity must be

encouraged while promoting the avenues to make

use of the abundant renewable energy sources in

the country, such as solar and wind power. Many

countries around the globe have made remarkable

inroads into exploiting renewable energy sources.

Countries like China are in the process of curbing

their dependence on polluting energy sources and

transitioning towards cleaner energy initiatives.

Some countries have announced bans on fossil

fuel powered vehicles within the next 10-20 year

time horizon paving way for greener energy

usage. Although Sri Lanka has moved towards

promoting greener electricity sources as laid out

in the Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan of

the country, the envisaged levels are below the

levels that are necessary to meet the relevant

United Nations Sustainable Development Goals

(SDGs), indicating the need for heightening these

efforts. Hence, Sri Lanka should further encourage

35

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

private sector institutions and households to invest

in renewable energy sources, thereby lessening

the burden on the public sector as well. Moreover,

taking measures to install a high quality efficient

public transportation system, while establishing an

electric vehicle charging network would promote

the drive towards greener and cost effective energy

sources leading to sustainable development in the

country. These measures would contribute towards

meeting the energy needs of a rapidly developing

economy at lower costs thereby contributing to

increase the overall efficiency and competitiveness

of the country.

The overdependence of the agriculture

sector on the government for subsidies

and other forms of protection needs to be

rationalised in view of their long term economic

costs. The agriculture sector receives a substantial

portion of government subsidies directly and

indirectly, given its importance for food security

and in consideration of the large number of the

population dependent on the sector. However,

such subsidies and price support schemes reduce

the efficiency of resource allocation and encourage

less productive farming practices. While around

two million people or a quarter of the labour

force are employed in the agriculture sector, its

contribution towards GDP stands at around 7-8

per cent. The continued use of traditional, labour-

oriented techniques of farming in the context of

rapid fragmentation of agricultural lands, have led

to low productivity of the agriculture sector, and

low incomes for the farming community. Excessive

protection extended to the sector also discourages

the potential movement of the labour force to more

productive sectors, such as manufacturing and the

leisure sector that experience continued labour

shortages. As Sri Lanka aspires to transform itself

to an efficiency driven economy, timely measures

are required to address the prevailing issues in the

agriculture sector. Agriculture or farming units need

to be transformed to profit-seeking business units

by way of upskilling, mechanising and inculcating

an entrepreneurial culture, which would help

generate higher income in the sector. In the same

vein, barriers to amalgamate these individual,

profit-seeking business units to form larger farming

organisations should be eliminated. Initiatives

must be encouraged to intensify competitiveness

through increased productivity, intensified

R&D, diversifying by cultivating more profitable

agricultural products and overcoming challenges

arising from climate change while reaping benefits

from Good Agriculture Practices (GAP), instead

of depending on excessive protection from the

government at a high social and economic cost.

Such initiatives to make the agriculture sector

independent, productive and competitive will

help ensure its positive contribution towards the

country’s growth momentum, going forward.

The untapped potential of Sri Lanka’s

industry sector must be exploited by

strengthening the manufacturing sector

through diversification as well as investment in

research and development (R&D). The industry

sector of Sri Lanka, is the second largest sector

of the economy after services, and within industry,

the manufacturing sector, contributed about 15.5

per cent of GDP in 2018. However, Sri Lanka’s

manufacturing sector is relatively small compared

to its regional counterparts such as China (around

29 per cent), Thailand (around 27 per cent),

Malaysia (around 22 per cent), and Bangladesh

(around 17 per cent). Similarly, as a percentage of

GDP, the share of medium and high-tech industrial

production within the manufacturing sector has

been notably low at around 7 per cent in Sri Lanka

compared to Singapore (80 per cent), Philippines

(46 per cent), Malaysia (43 per cent), China (41

per cent), Thailand (41 per cent), Vietnam (40 per

36

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

1

cent), India (38 per cent), Pakistan (25 per cent)

and Bangladesh (9 per cent) in 2015 as per World

Bank sources. This shows that Sri Lanka is lagging

behind its regional peers in the manufacturing of

medium and high-tech industry products. Another

major issue in the manufacturing sector is the low

spending on R&D, which reduces innovation and

thereby competitiveness. Sri Lanka’s investment in

R&D is the lowest in the region at 0.1 per cent of

GDP in 2014 while that of Singapore (2.2 per cent),

China (2.1 per cent), Malaysia (1.3 per cent), India

(0.6 per cent), Thailand (0.6 per cent) and Vietnam

(0.4 per cent) are higher as per the most recent

data available in the World Bank sources. Sri Lanka

also has only 100 people per million engaging in

R&D activities while peers in the region employ

a significantly higher number of people in R&D,

ranging from 294 people per million in Pakistan to

6,730 people per million in Singapore. Therefore,

Sri Lanka needs to increasingly focus on enhancing

R&D, particularly in the form of technology transfer

and applied industrial research, to improve the

industry sector performance over the long term.

Meanwhile, the surveys to capture investment

and employment in R&D must be strengthened to

obtain a more accurate picture of public and private

sector engagement in such activities.

Sri Lankan entrepreneurs must be supported

to graduate from small scale production

aimed at narrow markets to larger scale

operations in order to benefit from economies

of scale. In Sri Lanka, most economic activities

are operated by micro or small scale operators.

Although there may be merit in such small scale

operations at times, the benefit of economies of

scale does not accrue to the country. Accordingly,

high cost of production and low quality products

and services are key issues faced by most local

producers and consumers in Sri Lanka. Higher

local production costs lead to elevated domestic

prices compared to low imported prices, thereby

forcing the government to impose and adjust taxes

frequently to protect local producers. Although the

government receives revenue in the form of taxes,

this practice would distort market activity leading to

higher market prices, which would inconvenience

end consumers. Moreover, most export oriented

emerging markets capitalise on economies of scale,

which enable them to make substantial profits.

However, in Sri Lanka, for instance in the paddy

sector, the yield per hectare is low in districts with

a high percentage of small sized paddy fields while

a higher average yield is recorded in those districts

with comparatively large paddy fields, thereby

clearly indicating the prevalence of economies of

scale. Moreover, the usage of machinery would

also be more productive when the land extent is

larger. A possible solution would be to encourage

the pooling of lands into agriculture societies,

allow them to use more machinery and enhance

productivity, empower them to take decisions and

share profits based on the extent pooled. Further,

such societies would also benefit from enhanced

bargaining power. Similarly, the small scale of

business units is a common issue in the services

sector as well. For example, a privately operated

bus or a taxi, is a single business unit that is operated

individually without a goal other than maximising

individual profits. Due to such operations, benefits

of agglomeration arising from resource pooling and

associated synergies are lost, often resulting in a

reduction in individual profits as well. This situation

could be improved by forming entities, empowered

with decision making abilities on transport

operations of a region, where both government

and privately owned vehicles could be used. This

entity would be responsible for the management

of the fleet, efficient maintenance, preparation of a

comprehensive timetable, balancing low profit time

periods and low profit routes. Such a system will

increase the efficiency and the quality of service

37

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

provided, while also making public transport

increasingly attractive. Therefore, the policy focus

should be to support the transformation of small

scale, fragmented entities to large scale business

ventures, enabling such operations to benefit

from economies of scale and contribute towards

the growth objectives of the economy, while also

enhancing the overall welfare of the society. In the

case of industries, such transformation will help

realise the country’s untapped export potential as

well.

While the country’s unemployment rate has

remained low during the past several years,

reforms are required to improve and sustain

the contribution of labour resources towards

economic growth going forward. Upskilling the

labour force is imperative to support Sri Lanka’s

efforts to progress as an upper middle income

economy. Over the last several years, Sri Lanka

has observed low rates of unemployment, which

highlight the need for the implementation of well-

thought-out labour market reforms to encourage

the productive use of labour resources and also

boost the overall growth potential of the economy.

A primary concern in the labour market is the dismal

rate of female labour force participation. Although

university enrolment among females has increased

noticeably over the years, issues such as lack of

child and elderly care facilities, discrimination at the

workplace leading to widening gender pay gaps,

inflexible working hours and tight labour laws,

and the lack of safe transport have led to the poor

female participation in the labour market. Moreover,

a noticeable mismatch exists between the required

and available skills in the labour market. A concern

highlighted by the private sector, particularly foreign

companies, is the weak English language and

Information and Communication Technology (ICT)

skills of Sri Lankan workers, which have challenged

their employability, whilst also making the country

a less attractive investment destination. As per

the EF English Proficiency Index 2018, Sri Lanka

has been designated as a country with low English

proficiency compared to its regional counterparts

such as Singapore, Philippines, Malaysia,

India and Vietnam that display high or medium

proficiency, while Sri Lanka’s computer literacy

remained at a strikingly low level of 27.5 per cent

during the first half of 2018 as per the Department

of Census and Statistics. The shortage of low-

to medium-skilled labour in the manufacturing

sector and export agriculture has also led to an

increase in the cost of labour, thereby affecting

the competitiveness of exportable products. While

these issues form structural impediments to the

overall growth of the economy, several policy

initiatives have been proposed by the government

with a view to encouraging greater female labour

force participation and enhancing human capital

by upskilling the labour force through the provision

of better university and vocational training

opportunities. Measures are also expected to be

taken to provide reliable and affordable childcare

facilities by establishing nurseries and crèches,

thereby enabling mothers to return to their jobs.

Also, awareness campaigns and strict regulations

promoting zero tolerance should be introduced to

prevent sexual harassment of women both at work

and on public transport, while opportunities to work

part-time and flexible hours should be introduced

to attract the educated, but largely underutilised

female workforce. Sri Lanka’s education system

should also be aligned with the evolving needs

of the labour market, and the quality of education

should be improved by regularly updating the

school and university curricula, while graduate

training should better prepare students that match

the requirements of the labour market, particularly

the private sector. Greater emphasis should also

be placed on improving English and ICT skills as

well as other soft skills, such as working in teams

Changing Demographic Structure

Sri Lanka’s post-independence progress in terms of social indicators has been more satisfactory relative to the advancement of its economic indicators. This was one of the reasons for Sri Lanka’s demographic and epidemiological transition coming close to being on par with developed economies. The country’s population pyramid has changed notably during the past four decades owing to declining fertility and mortality rates together with increasing life expectancy and migration.1 Consequently, as one of the first developing economies to record below replacement level fertility, Sri Lanka’s population structure is expected to rapidly shift towards a higher concentration of the elderly, in the not-too-distant future. The share of the elderly population in Sri Lanka is projected to rise to 16.7 per cent by 2021 and further to 24.8 per cent by 2041 (De Silva, 2015). This indicates that approximately one in every four persons will be 60 years or above within the next two decades.

Although the longevity of the population highlights the benefits of investments the country has made on social infrastructure during the post-independence era (Osmani, 1993), population ageing brings about an array of challenges. In this backdrop, it is essential to analyse such socio-economic challenges and identify possible solutions, drawing from global experiences. This will help facilitate the implementation of national policies to enable a supportive environment for the elderly population within the broader development strategy to ensure the well-being of all, while reducing the fiscal burden of population ageing.

BOX 3Need for a Nationwide Contributory Pension Scheme amidst a Rapidly Ageing Population

Social, Healthcare and Economic Implications of Ageing

Although evolving, the Sri Lankan culture attaches significance to family values, which include taking care of the elderly. Accordingly, the responsibility of caring for the elderly in the family is considered a primary responsibility of the younger generation. The Census of Population and Housing - 2012 reveals that 99.0 per cent of the elderly live in household units while the remaining 1.0 per cent live in homes for the elderly. Nevertheless, rapidly changing lifestyles, urbanisation and demographic transition have put pressure on this traditional social protection system. More specifically, the decreasing family size, the diminishing role of the extended family due to internal migration from rural to urban areas or outward migration in search of better economic prospects, as well as the changing perceptions regarding supporting and caring for the elderly have largely contributed to this phenomenon. However, elderly care facilities and other social protection schemes, including retirement benefits have not expanded sufficiently to accommodate this change. Therefore the elderly population continues to rely on family members, who are also ageing. This social challenge is likely to become aggravated further with rising dependency ratios highlighting the need for an elderly care system that would support and supplement the traditional family based care system.

In addition to the demographic transition that is taking place in the country, the health profile of the elderly population has changed. While the prevalence of communicable or infectious diseases has reduced, the occurrence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) affecting principally the elderly has increased with rising standards of living, nutrition and sanitation. In Sri Lanka, a considerable number of elderly persons have NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, depression, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Managing these diseases would improve the wellbeing and quality of life of the ageing population. However, providing access to good quality healthcare services for the elderly population is a challenging task. The healthcare system still has considerable shortages in addressing the medical needs of the ageing population. For a majority of the population, treatment for inpatient care for cancer and emergency care for heart diseases are publicly financed to a great extent, whereas care for a substantial portion of NCDs is self-financed drawing on the services provided by the private sector. This shows the need to expand public and private healthcare services to suit the requirements of the ageing population and also highlights the increasing fiscal burden associated with the provision of public healthcare services.

Furthermore, the impact of ageing on the size and composition of the labour force will have major implications for economic growth. Due to low and

decreasing fertility rates, Sri Lanka will face a slower increase or a decline in the labour force. A decrease in the labour force could have a negative impact on economic growth unless the country encourages higher labour force participation and/or opens up for foreign labour. Fulfilling the needs of an increasing elderly population, who would be dependent on a shrinking labour force, will be more challenging when economic growth is low, thus burdening the government further. As the labour force is growing older while shrinking in size, it may have an impact on the overall efficiency of the economy. Besides the changes in the labour market, population ageing will also affect economic activity and growth performance through other channels such as consumption, investment and savings. When income levels decline with age, consumption levels may also decline and economic growth could be negatively affected by lower domestic demand. Similarly, the saving capacity could also decline with age, which could impact on the levels of savings and this, in turn, will have implications on investment.

Social Protection for the Elderly in Sri Lanka

The increase in the elderly population in Sri Lanka highlights the need for secure social security schemes where the quality of life and dignity of the elderly can be upheld. Social protection schemes available for formal sector workers in Sri Lanka can be broadly categorised based on the type of employment. The Public Sector Pension Scheme (PSPS) is available for government employees along with the armed forces pension scheme, widows, widowers and orphans pension (W & OP) scheme, and public servants’ provident fund. The PSPS is a non-contributory scheme where the public sector employees are assured a monthly income from the government during their lifetime. However, the W & OP scheme is contributory and provides for the spouse and dependent children below 18 years of age or any handicapped children irrespective of age after the death of the employee. Formal private sector employees are entitled to benefits under the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF) at the time of their retirement. EPF is a scheme contributed by both the employee and employer, while the employer contributes towards ETF. The employee is eligible to obtain the entire amount available in these funds at retirement, and in most cases, such funds are invested after retirement as time deposits in order to earn a monthly interest as living expenses. The government has also introduced pension schemes for farmers, fishermen and self-employed persons of the informal sector, but the popularity of these schemes is low. Meanwhile, a public assistance monthly allowance (PAMA) and an elderly assistance programme (EAP) are available for the low income elderly population of Sri Lanka. In 2017, the government approved granting of a monthly allowance of Rs. 5,000 for citizens over 100 years of age, with a view to ensuring security and welfare of such individuals. As the labour force participation rate in Sri Lanka is around 50 per cent (52.2 per cent in 2018

Q4 as per the Quarterly Report of the Sri Lanka Labour Force Survey), a considerable number of the population are excluded from the retirement benefits mentioned above. In addition, around 60 per cent of the labour force belong to the informal sector (58.0 per cent in 2017 as per the Quarterly Report of the Sri Lanka Labour Force Survey), with limited access to old age benefits. Therefore, a majority of the elderly population are not covered by any of these schemes, while the benefits received are inadequate to ensure a decent standard of living.

Moreover, the current pension framework is a considerable burden on already limited fiscal resources as it is a non-contributory scheme. Government expenditure on pensions has been on the rise and in 2018 Rs. 194.5 billion was incurred as pension payments accounting for 9.3 per cent of recurrent expenditure. By February 2019, there were 623,417 pensioners, i.e., 2.9 per cent of the total population. Hence, about 10 per cent of the government’s recurrent expenditure is spent directly on less than 3 per cent of the total population, which is not a sustainable model given the rapidly ageing population. According to the Census of Public and Semi Government Sector Employment conducted in 2016, 84,084 public and semi government sector employees, excluding armed forces (7.6 per cent of the total employed) were over 56 years of age and 854,300 (77.4 per cent) were between 30 – 55 years of age. This implies that the government will have to bear the cost of pensions of over 80,000 additional pensioners by 2020 and over 800,000 additional pensioners in the forthcoming 30 years. The current arrangements are an inter-generational time-bomb as future generations will have to bear the rapidly increasing fiscal burden. Since the PSPS is a non-contributory scheme with defined benefits, the burden on government expenditure will escalate in the coming years. In view of the unfunded nature of the PSPS, frequent upward revisions to pensions in the form of rectifying pension anomalies would not only result in the ballooning of government expenditure

on pensions but also increase the wedge between the pensioners and non-pensioners in the society in terms of their standard of living at the expense of current and future tax payers. Given the tight fiscal envelope, it is essential that viable policies and strategies are adopted to ensure social security of the elderly population, not only those who retire from the public service, but also those in the formal and informal private sector as well.

The existence of the Public Service Pension Scheme has also created unfavourable incentives among the working age population by creating a wedge between “good jobs” and “bad jobs”, as many prefer public sector employment rather than the private sector. This has led to inefficiencies in the labour market and disincentivised the labour force from moving from one sector to another, due to the inability to carry forward the accumulated pension benefits when switching employment from the public sector to the private sector and vice versa.

These concerns highlight the need to introduce a contributory pension scheme, which will be operated across the country covering the public, private and informal sectors. The contribution by the employee towards such a pension scheme would help to neutralise undue incentives attached to public sector employment. Such a scheme would ensure that the working population has some form of social security in their retirement, irrespective of the nature of employment an individual is engaged in, be it the public, private or informal sector. Once such a mechanism is in place, it will ease the fiscal burden by replacing the social benefit schemes currently in operation with a nationwide contributory pension scheme, which could also help contain the required expansion of government spending on healthcare as well.

Way Forward

Addressing issues related to changing population dynamics and rising fiscal burden lie partly with the implementation of a contributory nationwide pension scheme, covering both the public and the private sector. Such a contributory pension scheme would be successful if it brings the employee and employer as well as the government together to share the responsibility of paying

for retirement, where the employer and employee would contribute defined percentages based on earnings per month, and the government could contribute a defined amount indexed with inflation. These contributions could be invested in financial markets including government securities. When the employees reach the retirement age, their benefit could be returned in the form of an annuitised pension. Lessons can be drawn from peers in the region as well as developed economies, which operate such contributory pension schemes and transfer the benefits to employees on their retirement in the form of an annuitised pension. However, the implementation of such a nationwide contributory pension scheme would require consultation with all stakeholders, while avoiding policy swings from one government to another. A nationwide pension scheme with effective regulation would also help address issues with the fragmented pension schemes that are in operation at present in terms of their sustainability and would facilitate labour mobility between sectors as well. Moreover, it will ease the prevailing and projected expenditure burden on the government. Along with this nationwide contributory pension scheme, a choice of options need to be made available where affordable healthcare is provided for the elderly population who are unable to pay for their medical treatment, while maintaining more targeted and streamlined poverty alleviation programmes such as Samurdhi/Divineguma as they are essential to uplift the consumption levels of the poor in the short term and to increase their income generating capacity for them to graduate from poverty.

The government, having identified the growing challenge that Sri Lanka has to face with an ageing population, has proposed the introduction of a National Pension Plan with a sustainable financing structure in its Budget for 2019. As similar proposals have been made by previous governments, it is heartening to note that the need for such a scheme is accepted across the political divide. Given its increasing importance with rapid population ageing, it is essential that such a nationwide contributory pension scheme is formulated and implemented without delay.

and being accountable, that are highly sought by

employers in the present day. Measures could also

be taken to allow foreign talent in Sri Lanka’s labour

market by way of attracting recognised experts as

well as mid-career professionals in a transparent

manner, which would enhance knowledge-

sharing whilst also increasing the competition in

the labour market leading to better productivity.

Moreover, improving access to finance of those in

lagging regions would promote entrepreneurship

prospects. Overall, in the backdrop of an ageing

population, these policy initiatives will not only

attract more workers to the job market, but would

also enhance the contribution of the labour

force to the country’s growth process through

improved labour productivity. These initiatives

would ultimately improve the livelihood and living

standards of workers and their dependents, while

also enhancing equality and reducing overall

poverty in the economy.

Appropriate reforms to general education and

higher education are essential to increase the

growth potential of the economy. With the waning

of the demographic dividend and the comparative

advantage of a low wage regime, the next stage of

economic growth needs to be derived by uplifting

the quality of human capital of the country through

education. Although numerous policy measures

implemented in the education sector have enabled

Sri Lanka to attain commendable achievements in

primary and secondary education in terms of student

enrolment and gender equality, the education system

has failed to replicate the achievements of its regional

peers, particularly in terms of learning outcomes.

The lack of student engagement in STEM (Science,

Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and

vocational subject streams has resulted in the labour

demand for entrants with technical skills not being

met. In this regard, there are attempts to improve the

quality of education through initiatives such as the

‘13 years of guaranteed education’ programme, the

‘closest school is the best school’ initiative and the

introduction of STEM education in schools, which

is expected to be extended to cover Arts subjects

as well (STEM+A). However, lack of resources,

particularly in terms of qualified teachers and facilities,

has limited student engagement in STEM subjects

inhibiting entrants into these streams. Measures to

strengthen the education of technical and vocational

subjects within the school curricula should be

effectively implemented as delays in investments on

reshaping the education system to meet the rising

demands of the labour market would further erode

Sri Lanka’s competitiveness. Moreover, although

around 160,000 students were eligible for university

entrance during 2018, only around a fifth were

absorbed into the government university system.

In addition to the lack of opportunities for students

to engage in higher studies, a significant share also

face issues in finding suitable job placements on

graduation, suggesting a skills mismatch. Further,

capacity of the government tertiary education sector

should be enhanced both in terms of quantity and

quality with greater orientation towards awarding

professional qualifications. This needs to be

supplemented through the establishment of a proper

quality assurance framework for education services,

while encouraging further private sector participation

in providing such services.

The rising trend in non-communicable

diseases (NCDs) threatens the sustainability of

achievements in the health sector. Health statistics

show that a large share of early deaths in Sri Lanka

are due to NCDs such as high blood pressure, high

blood cholesterol, diabetes, chronic kidney disease

and cancer. Addiction to tobacco and alcohol,

unhealthy dietary habits, physical inactivity and air

pollution have been identified as key risk factors that

drive NCDs. It has been observed that cancer is one

of the rising threats among NCDs, with adolescents

42

and youth gradually becoming victims primarily due

to unhealthy lifestyles. The economic burden of

NCDs is larger compared to that of communicable

diseases due to their permanent nature. Costs of

NCDs include direct medical costs for treatment,

such as investigations and drugs, and indirect costs

to the economy, including loss of income due to

illness and absenteeism and lower productivity as

a result of deprived health conditions. Meanwhile,

Sri Lanka is facing a demographic transition with

an ageing population, who are more vulnerable

to chronic illnesses. This phenomenon is likely to

further increase the fiscal burden on medical and

welfare expenditure. Further, vulnerable households

are susceptible to catastrophic health expenditure

creating the potential to spiral into ‘medical poverty’,

if they seek care for NCDs from the private health

sector due to the inability of public health facilities

to cater to rising demands for health services in a

timely manner. In this backdrop, implementation

of urgent policy measures is essential to confront

this issue arising from NCDs that is threatening the

sustainability of achievements in the health sector.

Such measures could include awareness among the

public on NCD preventive lifestyles and improved

nutritional literacy, while making available the required

medicinal drugs and facilities at affordable rates

with the support of the private sector. In particular,

it is also important to take proactive measures to

lower the incidence of preventable cancers, while

controlling and combating determinants of cancers,

by ensuring early detection and providing holistic

and accessible cancer care. Moreover, in addition

to the individual based approaches, attention should

be paid to encouraging innovative community-based

approaches in preventing NCDs.

Despite excessive growth in public sector

employment over time, public sector service

delivery has stagnated due to inefficiencies

and non-optimal allocation of resources, thus

highlighting the urgent need for policy reforms

in the public sector, including the increased

use of modern technology. The number of people

served by a public official has decreased significantly

over the years demonstrating the high growth of

public sector employment compared to population

growth. However, the public sector output is far

below expectations, thus impacting negatively on

the economic and social wellbeing of the general

public. Inefficiency of the public service arises from

many fronts. Lack of independence from political

interference and inadequate protection to perform

duties properly are key deficiencies. Issues in relation

to recruitment procedures, promotional procedures

and performance appraisal also reduce the efficiency

of the public service and encourage the most efficient

employees to seek employment elsewhere. As a

result, the public service faces constraints in attracting

and retaining good quality workers. Further, the

general negative attitude of public servants towards

the people who require their services, and the fact

that most public servants consider their rights more

than responsibilities toward the society are also key

issues that need to be remedied. Temporary and

external appointment procedures to fill the crucial

positions at the helm of public administration have

also contributed to the subpar performance of the

public sector as many such appointees are not held

responsible for their actions later on. While many

of these issues need to be addressed through well

thought out public sector reform, it is essential that

short term solutions to increase the efficiency of

public sector services delivery are introduced using

technological advancements. Although some vital

systems have been automated, many more systems

in the public domain require urgent automation to

improve efficiency. Expediting the establishment of

a centralised system for personal identification and

revenue collection, which could be expanded to

cover agencies handling law and order, health and

education, and income redistribution is essential.

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

With Sri Lanka aspiring to maintain inflation

at mid single digit levels with the envisaged

adoption of the flexible inflation targeting

(FIT) framework by 2020, stakeholders of

the economy need to get accustomed to low

nominal rates of interest on financial products

in the future with reasonable real returns. Sri

Lanka has experienced large swings in market

interest rates both in nominal and real terms in

the past, and with the implementation of FIT that

targets inflation at mid single digit levels, a gradual

decline in nominal interest rates from their current

high levels is expected. Although savers will be

protected as positive real returns are envisaged

even after this transition, there may be an impact

on some savers, particularly senior citizens who

depend on interest income. This highlights the

need to introduce alternative financial products or

schemes that are safe and provide attractive returns

to savers including senior citizens. In this regard,

financial service providers could also assess

the possibility of bundling deposits with other

products such as medical insurance, which would

enhance overall benefits received by depositors.

Moreover, value added services such as offering

services of specialised financial gerontologists to

provide advice on savings best practices and how

the senior citizens could plan their financial flows

during retirement could be easily made available

to enhance the overall banking experience of the

elderly. As a long term solution, the government,

with the assistance of the private sector, could

introduce contributory pension schemes and

annuity schemes, while highlighting the growing

importance of such schemes in an era of low

interest rates, to prevent the sole dependence

on interest income during retirement. Further,

there is a need to increase awareness regarding

the benefits of alternative financial products,

such as mutual funds and unit trusts, to promote

investments in such instruments, which provide

a higher return when compared to plain vanilla

deposits. The timely introduction of such financial

products or schemes would support the livelihoods

of fixed income earning senior citizens in the low

inflation - low interest rate environment expected in

the period ahead.

While allowing the realisation of benefits

of technological advancement in payments

systems that were dominated by cash in the past,

the challenges arising from such developments

need to be addressed proactively. Although there

are notable improvements in the country’s national

payments system, cash is still the most popular

means of retail payment in Sri Lanka. The habit

of carrying cash is encouraged as only a limited

number of stores accept card payments or e-money

due to the costs involved, such as annual fees and

commissions, lack of required infrastructure as

well as to avoid the tax net. However, the cost of

handling cash is becoming increasingly challenging,

for the users of cash as well as the financial

institutions and the Central Bank. Therefore, this

practice needs to be gradually replaced with a

more secure cashless payment medium, thereby

encouraging and inculcating a tradition of cashless

transactions as in many other emerging market as

well as advanced economies. The increased use

of cashless modes of transactions will not only

improve the transparency of financial flows, but

would also reduce illegal and informal economic

activity. Meanwhile, the increased use of mobile

electronic devices such as smartphones by the

public has created an enabling platform, thereby

widening the avenues available for cashless

transactions, including e-banking and e-wallets.

Although mobile phone penetration in Sri Lanka

was around 150 per cent in 2018, mobile based

payments as a percentage of total retail payments

was minute relative to other countries. Nevertheless,

digital payments are expected to replace traditional

44

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

cash transactions in the near future and in such

a transformational phase, blockchain technology

will be a key payment platform going forward. In

this context, timely acquisition of the required

technological expertise would be imperative for all

stakeholders, particularly banks, merchants and

end users, so as to keep up with the advances in

payment technologies. While such developments

are expected to reshape the financial landscape of

the country, it would also enhance the efficiency and

overall stability of the financial system of Sri Lanka.

The Central Bank and other financial institutions are

expected to strengthen precautionary measures to

enhance cybersecurity by providing the required

infrastructure and increasing consumer awareness

about such technologies.

The national policy agenda needs to be

constantly reviewed to ensure that the country’s

progress is aligned with the framework of the

United Nations’ Sustainable Development

Goals (SDG) enabling the country to achieve

sustained prosperity. SDGs emphasise the

importance of addressing a country’s economic,

social and environmental issues in a holistic

manner. The SDG agenda is essentially an action

plan to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure

prosperity for all. Although poverty levels in Sri

Lanka have declined, extreme poverty pockets and

income disparities still exist within the country. This

highlights the need for proper targeting of poverty

alleviation programmes with special focus on

vulnerable groups such as economically deprived

social groups, elderly and disabled people. Further,

social safety nets also need to be strengthened

to support those who are living just above the

poverty line and are more susceptible to fall back

to poverty during adverse economic conditions.

In addition, the livelihoods of poor people can be

uplifted through financial inclusion, provision of

infrastructure facilities as well as education and

skills development. Enhancing financial literacy

and access to financial markets are imperative

to promote the livelihoods of the poor in order to

reduce their reliance on government transfers in

the long run. Education and skills development

also help improve the standards of living of the

population through improved employability, thereby

alleviating poverty and income inequality. In the

meantime, despite the substantial investments

made in physical infrastructure in recent years,

it is important for policymakers to also focus on

the environmental impact of such investments

in order to ensure long run socioeconomic

sustainability in line with SDGs. In this regard, the

promotion of green financing initiatives is key to

driving environmentally sustainable infrastructure

development. Essentially, a strong collective

effort by all stakeholders led by the government,

is required if Sri Lanka is to achieve the SDGs

by 2030. In addition, policies adopted by the

government must ensure consistency with the

SDG agenda.

Sri Lanka’s disaster risk management

policies and strategies could be strengthened

further with timely information dissemination,

appropriate use of modern technology and

supporting economic partnerships. Sri Lanka has

been affected by a series of natural disasters in the

recent past, which have had an adverse impact on

the economy and the society as a whole. Although

disasters cannot be avoided completely, the disaster

risks and their consequences could be mitigated to

a great extent by identifying and using technological

advancements, especially in the fields of data

collection and emergency responses. Disaster

prone countries, such as Japan, are increasingly

relying on modern technological developments

including drones, satellite imagery through

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and real-

time disaster modelling, in order to enhance the

45

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

level of responsiveness and improve the efficiency

of disaster risk management policies. Further,

real time data generated by modern sophisticated

equipment would also allow disaster management

institutions to develop more targeted response plans

which allow better emergency preparedness and

monitoring strategies. With the advent of smartphone

technology, disaster management strategies have

also been reshaped in the world in which real time

information on disasters or weather related dynamics

is alerted by individuals. Social media has also

taken a technological leap in terms of emergency

responsiveness during a disaster period, which

allows emergency response crews to connect with

survivors within a short period of time. Considering

the above, Sri Lanka needs to capitalise on these

modern technological developments with proper

coordination between policymaking institutions and

data generating agencies relevant to disaster risk

management, with the support of the private sector

where necessary.

The recent weak performance of the Sri

Lankan economy and the limited policy spaces

highlight the challenges that the country is

now facing due to delaying growth supportive,

yet unpopular, structural reforms. Although

successive governments have expressed their

intention to reform the economy through a number

of policy documents, the key stumbling block

has been the implementation of such proposals

effectively while ensuring policy consistency and

coordination amongst all stakeholders, in a manner

that would improve delivery of public services as

well as strengthen ‘Doing Business’ conditions

to support private sector led economic growth.

However, the country can no longer afford to

postpone such reforms, if Sri Lanka is to progress

along a high and sustainable growth trajectory over

the medium term and catch up with countries that

were behind Sri Lanka several decades ago.
