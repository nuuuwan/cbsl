4.1 OverviewT

he general price level, as measured

by the official consumer price indices,

fluctuated largely in line with the price

movements of the Food category, which declined

mostly, during 2018, owing to favourable weather

conditions that prevailed during the year.

Consequently, year-on-year headline inflation

moved on an overall decreasing trend, while

year-on-year underlying inflation remained at

low levels during the year. Even with the sharp

depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee during

the latter part of 2018, the widely expected

upward pressure on the price levels was not

observed from the behaviour of consumer price

indices, mainly due to well anchored inflation

expectations, administered pricing mechanisms

applied to most of the imported essential items

and the decline in oil prices during the last

two months of 2018. Inflation expectations,

particularly that of the corporate sector, were

well aligned with actual inflation. However,

the gap between short-term and long-term

inflation expectations widened, compared to

the previous year. In terms of developments

in real wages, growth was observed only in the

informal private sector, partly caused by labour

shortages in certain sectors, whilst an erosion

of real wages was observed in both public and

formal private sectors during 2018. In contrast

to the trend observed in the recent past, the

labour force declined in 2018, compared to

the previous year. Further, a widening in the

gender gap within labour force participation,

a decline in the employed population and an

increase in the overall unemployment rate

were observed in 2018. Unemployment among

youth, females and educationally qualified

categories continued to remain at high levels,

despite concerns regarding labour shortages

across many sectors. Amidst a decline in foreign

employment opportunities, female departures

under the housemaid category increased,

in contrast to the declining trend observed

during the past five years. Meanwhile, in 2018,

the number of man days lost due to strikes

declined by 14.4 per cent for the private sector

industries, while it increased significantly in the

plantation sector, compared to the previous

year.

4.2 Prices

Movements of the General Price Level

The general price level as measured by

the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI,

2013=100) and Colombo Consumer Price Index

(CCPI, 2013=100),1 exhibited mixed movements

during 2018 and largely followed the movement

of prices of the items in the Food category.

Due to supply side improvements supported by

favourable weather conditions that prevailed during

most parts of 2018, prices of items in the Food

category mostly remained at low levels during the

year. The prices of items in the Non-food category,

which moved on an increasing trend during the

year, except for December 2018, contributed

partially towards the upward movement of the

general price level.

As observed in the previous years, price

movement of the Food category closely

followed the movement of Volatile Food2 prices

in 2018. The declining trend of Volatile Food

prices during the first four months of 2018 was

mainly driven by the declines observed in prices

of rice, vegetables and onions, in addition to the

intermittent declines observed in the prices of

coconut, fresh fish and potatoes. Due to supply

shortages during the off season, prices of items in

the Volatile Food namely, fresh fish, vegetables,

potatoes and onions increased, particularly during

the months of May and June. Thereafter, Volatile

Food prices declined during August to October,

mainly due to the price declines of rice, coconut,

fresh fish and vegetables. Notable price increases

observed in the Volatile Food prices, in November,

were mainly due to the supply side disruptions

1 The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), compiles official consumer price indices, namely, National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100) and Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100) on a monthly basis. The NCPI demonstrates the price movements of selected consumer items at the national level while the CCPI reflects the same among urban households in the Colombo district.

2 Volatile Food includes rice, meat, fresh fish and seafood, coconut, fresh fruits, vegetables, potatoes, onions and selected condiments.

caused by adverse weather conditions. However, in

December, prices of Volatile Food items remained

at relatively lower levels. The prices of various rice

varieties moderated during 2018, mainly due to

recovery in paddy production owing to favourable

weather conditions. The price of coconut declined

throughout 2018 due to the recovery in coconut

production, as a result of favourable weather

conditions and import of coconut kernel since

December 2017. The prices of fresh fish, which

were at low levels at the beginning of the year,

increased sharply in the second quarter of 2018 due

to low production, resulting from adverse weather

conditions and fishermen’s protests against the

increase of kerosene price by the government.

However, fish prices eased during the remaining

months of 2018.

In contrast to the movement of the prices of

Volatile Food items, prices of the Food category

excluding the Volatile Food items moved on an

overall increasing trend in 2018, mainly due to

intermittent price increases observed in items

such as milk powder, dried fish, bread, wheat

flour and canned fish. A price revision in milk

powder took place after almost three years where the

price of a 400g packet was increased by Rs. 20 on

04 May 2018, considering the price developments in

the world market. However, a Customs Duty waiver of

Rs. 50 per kilogramme of milk powder was introduced

with effect from 19 September 2018. The prices

of wheat flour and bread were revised upward by

Rs. 5 each with effect from 01 and 04 September

2018, respectively. Reversing its increasing trend

observed in 2017, the price of sugar moved on an

overall declining trend during the year except for

September and October 2018, where significant price

hikes were observed. Further, a Maximum Retail

Price (MRP) of Rs. 100 and Rs. 105 were imposed on

unpacketed and packeted white sugar, respectively,

with effect from 13 October 2018, to contain the price

pressure. The Special Commodity Levy (SCL) on

dhal, which was revised upward in May 2018, was

revised downward in November 2018. As a result,

dhal prices were on a declining trend during the

year. It is noteworthy that the price of dhal remained

at lower levels, in 2018, in comparison to several

previous years.

Prices of the items in the Non-food category

moved on an increasing trend during the year

except in December 2018. With the introduction

of a pricing formula to determine fuel prices in

accordance with global fuel price movements, upward

adjustments occurred in May, July, September and

October, while downward adjustments occurred

during November and December. Subsequent to

fuel price revisions, upward and downward price

revisions to bus fares and three-wheel fares occurred

during the year. Meanwhile, a 15 per cent increase

to train fares came into effect from 01 October 2018

after a lapse of ten years. However, the minimum

train fare remained unchanged. Moreover, LP gas

prices indicated an overall increase during the year

subsequent to several price revisions, considering

the soaring gas prices in the world market and

depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar. This,

in turn, contributed towards the price increase in

prepared food items in the Restaurants and Hotels

sub-category. A rise in the tuition fees for secondary

education was observed at the beginning of the

year, while prominent price increases in payments to

laboratory tests and room charges of private hospitals

were observed in November 2018. Prices of items in

the Clothing and Footwear sub-category increased,

during 2018, compared to the previous year, due to

the depreciation of the domestic currency. However,

its impact on Consumer Price Indices (CPIs) was

marginal, as its weights are relatively minimal.

Consumer Price Indices

National Consumer Price Index

The NCPI exhibited mixed movements

during 2018, recording 125.8 index points in

January and reaching 127.1 index points in

December. During the first three months of the

year, the NCPI decreased on a month-on-month

basis mainly due to the declines observed in

the prices of the items in the Food category and

increased thereafter until July on account of

increases in prices of the items in the Non-food

category. Meanwhile, price increases observed in

the items in the Food category also contributed

to the month-on-month increase of the NCPI

that was observed in May and June 2018. The

month-on-month decline observed in the NCPI

during August and September was attributed to

the decrease in prices of the items in the Food

category, whereas the increase in the NCPI during

October was driven solely by the increase in the

prices of the items in the Non-food category. The

NCPI increased in November and decreased in

December owing to changes in the prices of the

items in both Food and Non-food categories.

Colombo Consumer Price Index

The CCPI also exhibited a similar trend to

that of the NCPI during the year. The CCPI

increased from 122.8 index points in January 2018

to 126.3 index points in December 2018. In terms

of contribution, the change in the CCPI was mainly

attributed to the movements of the prices of the

items in the Food category, whereas prominent

contributions from the prices of the items in the

Non-food category were observed only in certain

months. Owing to the month-on-month decrease in

the prices of the items in the Food category, the

CCPI decreased during the first three months of

2018. However, the CCPI increased thereafter

until August 2018, due to increases in prices of

the items in both Food and Non-food categories.

The movement of CCPI in April and August was

solely driven by the increase in the prices of

items in the Non-food category. Afterwards, the

CCPI decreased until October in response to the

declining prices of items in the Food category.

The price increases in items in both Food and

Non-food categories contributed to its increase in

November, while the increase in prices of items

in the Food category contributed to its increase in

December.

Headline Inflation

The headline inflation, as measured by

year-on-year change in the NCPI, exhibited

an overall declining trend with mixed

movements during 2018. As such, the NCPI

based year-on-year headline inflation remained

below 4.0 per cent during 2018, except for January,

which recorded 5.4 per cent. In October 2018, the

headline inflation declined to 0.1 per cent, recording

the lowest value since January 2016. The observed

low headline inflation rate was mainly attributable

to the high base that prevailed, in 2017, due to

high food prices. The NCPI based food inflation

demonstrated a similar trend to that of NCPI

headline inflation during the year. The NCPI based

food inflation in October 2018 was -6.6 per cent, the

lowest since January 2016. However, the NCPI based

Non-food inflation exhibited an increasing trend

during the first ten months of 2018 and declined

thereafter. Meanwhile, the NCPI based annual

average inflation reversed its increasing trend

observed during 2017 and declined continuously

from 7.6 per cent in January 2018 to 2.1 per cent

in December 2018.

Headline inflation, as measured by the

year-on-year change of CCPI, mostly remained

within the target band of 4.0-6.0 per cent

during the first nine months of 2018 and

decreased below 4.0 per cent thereafter. The

decline observed in CCPI based headline

inflation from January to March was due to

declining prices of items in the Food category. It

followed an increasing trend during May to August

recording a peak of 5.9 per cent in August and

gradually declined to 2.8 per cent in December.

The base effect was the lone contributor towards

the decrease in CCPI based headline inflation

in April and the increase of the same in August

2018. The CCPI based food inflation, in October,

was -2.3 per cent, the lowest since January 2016.

The annual average CCPI inflation declined from

6.6 per cent, in January 2018, to 4.3 per cent, in

December 2018, while recording 5.6 per cent for

three consecutive months from June to August

2018.

Inflation arising from imported items in the

consumer basket of the official price indices

declined during the early months of 2018 and

subsequently reversed its trend recording a

peak in October and declined thereafter. The

administered pricing mechanisms applicable

to various imported essential items along with

downward adjustments to fuel prices in the local

market contributed towards this decline observed

during the latter part of 2018. Further, reduction

in bus fares and SCLs, market competition and

the agriculture sector recovery also impacted

favourably in achieving subdued inflation levels

amidst the sharp rupee depreciation towards the

end of the year.

Core Inflation

The NCPI based year-on-year core inflation,

which reflects the underlying inflation in the

economy, remained subdued during the year.

In the first five months of 2018, the NCPI based

core inflation gradually declined from 2.1 per cent

in January 2018 to 1.7 per cent in May 2018.

However, it increased thereafter recording 3.4 per cent

in October, its peak for the year, and decreased to

3.1 per cent in November and December 2018.

The increases observed from June to September

were due to increases observed in the prices of

the items in both Food and Non-food categories,

whereas the increase observed, in October, was

solely due to the increase of the prices of items

in the Non-food category. Meanwhile, the CCPI

based year-on-year core inflation increased from

3.5 per cent, in January, to 3.9 per cent, in July,

before declining to 3.1 per cent in December 2018.

The movement of the CCPI based core inflation

moved in line with the price trends of the items in

the Non-food category since it occupies a higher

weight in the CCPI basket.

Producer Price Inflation

The producer price inflation measured by

the year-on-year change in the Producer’s Price

Index (PPI, 2013 Q4=100) displayed an overall

declining trend with mixed movements during

the year. The year-on-year producer price inflation

of the agriculture sub-sector decreased until

October 2018 and increased thereafter, while that

of the manufacturing sub-sector demonstrated an

overall increase with mixed movements during the

year. However, the producer price inflation in the

electricity and water supply sub-sector remained

stable during 2018.

GDP Deflator

The GDP deflator, which measures

the price movements of all domestically

produced goods and services in the economy,

decreased during 2018 compared to the

previous year mainly due to subdued price

movements observed in both agriculture and

services related activities. Accordingly, the

overall GDP deflator decreased to 4.3 per cent

in 2018 compared to 8.2 per cent in 2017. The

agriculture sector deflator declined significantly

from 17.6 per cent, in 2017, to 4.0 per cent,

in 2018, while the services sector deflator

decreased from 6.6 per cent to 4.9 per cent in

2018. However, the industry sector deflator

increased marginally from 5.4 per cent, in 2017,

to 5.5 per cent in 2018.

Inflation expectations of the corporate

sector declined, in 2018, aligning well with

the trends of actual inflation. However, it

was observed that the gap between long-term

and short-term inflation expectations widened

compared to the previous year as the corporate

sector expects an increase in inflation in the long-term.

Weakening of the domestic currency, supply side

disruptions and lack of stability and growth were

the main reasons cited by respondents for their

expected level of long-term inflation. Inflation

expectations of the corporate sector have closely

The need for measuring house price inflation using internationally comparable property price indices was strongly felt after the 2008 global financial crisis, followed by economic stagnation, where the burst of the property bubble in the United States was a major cause. Post-crisis investigations have highlighted certain important economic and financial data gaps hindering policymakers from better assessing the conditions of the economy and responding effectively. Compiling property price indices, for both residential and commercial segments, was one of the proposals1 of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to fill this information gap. This was endorsed by the G20 countries and also prompted many other countries to explore ways and means of compiling property price indices.

It is important to monitor the movements of house prices since affordability and price changes have a direct impact on consumer spending, which in turn affects price stability. Moreover, the real estate sector related activities contribute significantly to economic growth, where considerable changes in the sector leads to volatility in overall economic growth. The real estate segment has an immense influence on the financial market as well, due to its exposure to financial institutions through loans and advances. Therefore, high quality and timely property price indices serve as leading indicators for economic growth as well as the stability and soundness of the financial system, making them an essential input into the monetary policy and financial policy formulation process. In addition, the expectations of higher future returns from the property market would attract foreign investment to the economy. Thus, availability of reliable and comparable property price indices would be useful for potential investors to compare against other investment options as well as international property markets.

Although the concept of property price indices is a relatively new phenomenon for many countries, some countries have been compiling them for a considerable period of time. Nevertheless, developing an index to capture temporal fluctuations of property prices is extremely challenging, due to the highly heterogeneous nature of property, where no two entities are identical, and also due to changes in quality over time (because of changes to close by amenities, technological advancements that make the existing facilities obsolescent etc.). Further, since properties are not transacted frequently, only a few directly comparable sales would exist during a given period for a given market. Due to these reasons, it is essential to perform quality adjustments in compiling property price indices. After significant research into these concerns, a group of experts consisting of

1 In October 2009, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) presented a report to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, proposing 20 recommendations (G20 Data Gap Initiatives – Phase I and II) to be implemented to address the data gaps identified.

BOX 05Compiling Property Price Indices: An Application to the Condominium Market in Sri Lanka

both academics and practitioners has come up with international manuals2 on price indices, which present four main methodologies, namely, Stratification or Mix Adjustment method, Hedonic Regression method, Repeat Sales method and Appraisal-Based method, which are used globally to adjust for quality in estimating property price indices. Out of these, the Hedonic Regression method has been recommended as the most suitable technique available at present to construct a constant quality index, provided a data source with required granular levels is available.

Property Price Indices for Sri Lanka

The property market is a significant component of the economy in the Sri Lankan context as well, complemented by the recent expansion in the real estate sector, especially in relation to the condominium segment. Accordingly, in line with global practices, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) also decided to expand its surveillance to cover these new developments. As a result, compiling a Residential Property Price Index focusing on the condominium segment was initiated in 2016, in addition to the Land Price Index (LPI)3 available since 1998. Considering the constraints in obtaining information on official sales transactions that have occurred during a specific period of time due to the lack of automated platforms and the unavailability of granular level data in official records, alternative data sources were explored. Accordingly, an initial residential property price index was compiled on a monthly basis using advertised prices. However, prices obtained through this process may not indicate the actual transacted prices, which are normally lower than the advertised prices. Moreover, all advertised properties may not be sold during the period concerned. Further, under this methodology, neither was it possible to recognise the reasons behind price movements nor to obtain market specific information. To address these concerns, it was decided to launch a Condominium Market Survey, which would not only provide information on actual property sales to compile a price index, but also a more holistic view of the market.

Condominium Market Survey

The Condominium Market Survey was launched during the 3rd quarter of 2017 with a view to obtaining market information, including sales prices on a quarterly basis. The respondents consist of the members of the

2 This includes the “Handbook on Residential Property Prices Indices (RPPIs)”, which was published in 2013 by Eurostat with the aim of facilitating the setting-up of residential property price indices in countries by giving practical guidance on the compilation of house price indices, and the publication “Commercial Property Price Indicators: Sources, Methods and Issues”, which was published in 2017 by Eurostat including the sources of data and methodologies in relation to Commercial Property Price Indices (CPPIs).

3 The CBSL compiled LPI (base year: 1998) annually from 1998-2008 and bi-annually from 2009-2017, covering 5 Divisional Secretariat (DS) divisions in the Colombo District using per perch land price data for residential, commercial and industrial lands collected from the Government Valuation Department. With the increasing importance of monitoring land prices due to the recent developments in the real estate sector, the geographical coverage of LPI was later expanded to cover all DS divisions in the Colombo District and revised its base period to 1st half of 2017.

Condominium Developers Association of Sri Lanka (CDASL) and other market players. Market information is obtained through a questionnaire distributed among the survey participants.

Compilation of Condominium Property Price Index

Considering the heterogeneity of condominium units, it was decided to employ the Hedonic Regression method in compiling the Condominium Property Price Index for Sri Lanka to adjust for quality, since it recognises a residential property as a bundle of characteristics. A vital part in this process is selecting the price determining features, which would be considered as the explanatory variables in the regression. Based on responses to the survey, other country experiences and measurability, the following eight variables were selected to be used in the regression.

The Condominium Property Price Index for each period was arrived at using representative prices derived through the regressions. At present, the Index is at preliminary stages of development, hence considered only for internal analysis and not available in the public domain.

Market Information obtained through the Condominium Market Survey

As per the information provided by the property developers, the number of sales transactions reported per quarter remained relatively stable except for the 1st quarter of 2018.4 According to the analysis of the composition of sales transactions, the share of the category of condominiums priced below Rs. 25 million shows an increase, while the shares of other categories have declined during the period under review. When the reported sales transactions are categorised based on the type of development5 and the location, it was found that the sales are still concentrated in the Colombo District with the majority of units sold belonging to single condominium projects.

4 The number of condominium sales transactions increased substantially during the 1st quarter of 2018 due to a possible price rise with effect from 1st April, 2018 as per the budget proposal to impose 15 per cent Value Added Tax (VAT) on condominium sales, which was later postponed by one year.

5 Since a standardised/accepted method to classify condominiums is not available, the condominium projects reported to the survey were classified into two categories, namely, mixed development projects and single condominium projects, based on the type of the development. A mixed development project includes hotels, office spaces, entertainment facilities etc., in addition to the residential spaces, whereas a single condominium project consists of residential spaces only.

As per the information provided by 26 condominium developers to the latest survey, 7,659 completed condominium units were available by end 2018, while reported numbers for ongoing and planned units were 9,564 and 6,332, respectively. Considering the sales, it is identified that, 95 per cent of the units in completed condominium projects have been sold. Further, 48 per cent of the units in ongoing mixed development projects and 53 per cent of the units in ongoing single condominium projects, were reserved by end 2018.

the nominal wages of public sector employees,

as measured by the annual average change in

the Public Sector Wage Rate Index (2012=100),

increased marginally by 0.1 per cent in 2018. Real

wages of public sector employees declined by

2.0 per cent in 2018 as a result of the low inflation

that prevailed during the year, compared to the real

wage erosion of 7.2 per cent in 2017. However,

according to the Public Administration Circular

No. 03/2016, the increase in nominal wages of public

sector employees will be higher during the next two

years than the increase observed during the previous

three years. In addition, a fifteen-member Special

Salaries Commission was appointed to resolve salary

anomalies in the public sector in August 2018.

Private Sector Wages

Nominal wages of the employees in the

formal private sector, as measured by the

annual average change in the minimum

Wage Rate Index (1978 December=100) of

employees whose wages are governed by the

responded to monetary and fiscal policy measures

with a lag. Even though inflation expectations of the

household sector naturally remain at a level higher

than the expectations of the corporate sector, it

also followed a declining trend in 2018.

4.3 Wages

During 2018, wage rate indices indicated

signs of wage pressure in the economy at a

lower magnitude with easing inflation. The

real wage erosion was prominent in the public

and formal private sectors as there was only a

marginal increase in nominal wages, in 2018,

compared to 2017. Therefore, the demand

pressure arising from wages on the general price

level remained subdued during the year.

Public Sector Wages

The process of including the special

allowance and interim allowance to the basic

salary of public sector employees continued for

the third consecutive year in 2018. Accordingly,

When the funding structure of condominium developments is considered, according to developers’ responses, funds were mainly generated through bank loans, pre-sale deposits and equity. In addition, it could be observed that the majority of the condominium buyers were resident Sri Lankans and most of them have purchased condominium units for living rather than investment. The majority of buyers have purchased condominium units using their own funds.

Way Forward

Given the prevailing constraints on data collection, the CBSL is working on expanding the geographical coverage and increasing the response rate of the existing data sources to improve the representativeness of the Index and other market information. In addition, exploring further avenues utilising big data concepts and liaising with other relevant stakeholders are in the pipeline and will be implemented shortly. In line with these, the CBSL is in constant dialogue with international counterparts to gather experience on addressing the challenges faced in developing property price indices via participating in subject specific training, forums, seminars and research conferences. The compilation methodology is also expected to be improved, in consultation with global experts, to gauge the sentiments of the property market as a leading economic indicator to strengthen the evidence based forward looking policy making process, in Sri Lanka. Subsequent to these enhancements and sufficient maturity of the data series, the Index would be published for the information of the general public.

Wages Boards Trades3, increased marginally

by 0.6 per cent in 2018. This was mainly due

to the increase of minimum wages in printing,

of employees in the formal private sector declined

by 3.5 per cent during 2018, compared to the

decline of 5.9 per cent recorded in 2017. The

Ministry of Labour and Trade Union Relations

has initiated discussions, in 2018, to increase

minimum wages from the current level of Rs.10,000

sector initiated a strike demanding a minimum daily

wage of Rs.1,000. However, the basic daily wage

of plantation sector employees was increased to

Rs.700 from Rs.500, in early 2019.

A growth in both nominal and real wages

was observed in the informal private sector,

in 2018, as wages in the informal sector are

mostly determined by demand and supply

informal private sector increased significantly by

10.8 per cent, in 2018, owing to the increase in

nominal wages and low level of inflation observed

during the year.

4.4 Population, Labour Force and Employment

Population

The mid-year population, in 2018, was

estimated at 21.7 million with an annual growth

rate of 1.1 per cent, unchanged from the growth

rate observed during the past two years. In line

with the population growth, the population density4

increased to 346 people per square kilometre, in 2018,

from 342 people per square kilometre in 2017. The

Western province, which is the leading contributor to

GDP as per provincial GDP estimates compiled by

the CBSL, accounted for the highest share of mid-year

population of 28.3 per cent, while Central, Southern and

North-Western provinces accounted for 12.7 per cent,

12.2 per cent and 11.7 per cent, respectively, in 2018.

Northern province, which had a share of 5.2 per cent,

continued to account for the lowest share of the

mid-year population. The population is anticipated to

grow further in the coming years driven by anticipated

positive net migration, caused by the immigrant

workforce attached to mega development projects

carried out in Sri Lanka.

The population share in the age category

of 60 years and above, which accounted to

12.4 per cent5 of the mid-year population, is

relatively high compared with other South Asian

countries. This is also a relatively large figure

for a developing country. Low mortality rates and

international labour migration trends have caused

this structural shift in the age composition over

the years. The ageing population phenomenon

poses further challenges to the economic growth

of Sri Lanka in the form of low productivity, low

labour force participation rate, low consumption

rates, low savings, increase in elderly dependency

ratio and increase in public expenditure in terms

of social welfare and healthcare. Therefore,

policies related to phased retirement, increasing

the retirement age and upskilling should be

considered for implementation in order to engage

the population in economic activity for longer.

Labour Force

In contrast to the trend observed in the recent

past, the labour force, which is the economically

active population6 aged 15 years and above,

declined by 2.1 per cent to 8.388 million in 2018,

from 8.567 million recorded in 2017. This decline

in the labour force was due to the reduction

in female labour force by 6.7 per cent in 2018

compared to the previous year. The decline in

the female labour force was prominent in the rural

sector where 78.7 per cent of the female labour

force is concentrated. Along with the fall in the

labour force, the employed population declined

by 2.4 per cent to 8.015 million in 2018, from

8.208 million recorded in 2017, while the

unemployed population increased by 3.9 per cent

in 2018. Meanwhile, an increase in economic

inactivity was prominent during 2018 mainly due

to the increase in economically inactive population

by 8.4 per cent in the rural sector. As the household

population, which is the total of economically

active and economically inactive persons,

expanded by 2.2 per cent in 2018, the Labour

Force Participation Rate (LFPR)7 decreased to

51.8 per cent from 54.1 per cent in 2017.

The gender gap in labour force participation

widened during 2018, as the female LFPR

decreased to 33.6 per cent from 36.6 per cent

recorded in 2017. Sri Lanka still lags behind

in the female participation in the workforce,

despite the increasing number of educationally

and professionally qualified females. As such, a

substantial proportion of working age females are

not economically contributing to the national

economy. A number of factors, such as issues

in marketable skills, narrowed choices in the

labour market, gender discriminations related to

employment opportunities, wages and promotions,

harassment at work and public transport services,

unfavourable social norms, unavailability of

affordable child care facilities and the multiple social

roles and responsibilities expected to be performed

by Sri Lankan females, hinder female participation in

the workforce. Therefore, national level policies on

gender equality and non-discrimination, including

zero tolerance for sexual harassment, supportive

working arrangements, such as flexible working

hours and work from home and support facilities

such as affordable and high quality child and elder

care, and safe transportation, are essential to

provide a conducive environment for females to

be more economically active. These initiatives will

have a significant impact on increasing the LFPR

as a whole, which would, in turn, contribute to the

country’s economic growth.

Employment

During 2018, employed population

decreased by 2.4 per cent to 8.015 million from

8.208 million recorded in 2017. The majority of

the employed population continued to represent

the services sector with a share of 46.6 per cent

of the total employment in 2018. The industry

sector contributed a share of 27.9 per cent of the

total employment in 2018, while the agriculture

sector contribution was 25.5 per cent, compared to

26.1 per cent in the previous year. Accordingly,

the share of employed population in the agriculture

sector continued to decline in 2018, signalling the

structural shift in employment.

As per the Quarterly Labour Force Survey

conducted by the DCS, the private sector

continued to be the main employment generating

sector in Sri Lanka representing the largest

share of 43.4 per cent of the total employment in

2018. The self-employed category, which consists

of three groups, employers, own account workers

and contributing family workers, also represented a

large share of 42.2 per cent of the total employment

during the year. Accordingly, own account workers,

contributing family workers and employer categories

represented shares of 32.3 per cent, 7.2 per cent

and 2.8 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, the public

sector represented a share of 14.5 per cent of the

total employment in 2018.

As per the Public-Sector Employment Survey

conducted by the Central Bank, total public

sector employment was 1.411 million at the end

of 2018, compared to 1.397 million in 2017. This

includes employees in ministries, departments,

district secretariats, divisional secretariats, provincial

councils and semi government institutions.

Unemployment

The unemployment rate increased to

4.4 per cent in 2018, from 4.2 per cent that

was recorded in 2017, with the highest

unemployment rates being reported in

females, youth and educationally qualified

categories. A high female unemployment

rate along with the low female LFPR remain

critical issues that need immediate policy

interventions in order to create a level playing

field for economically active females. With

regard to unemployment among the youth,

high unemployment rates of 21.4 per cent

and 10.4 per cent were reported from the age

categories of 15-24 years and 25-29 years

respectively, in 2018. In terms of educational

qualifications, an unemployment rate of

9.1 per cent was reported from the GCE A/L

and above category in 2018, compared to

8.1 per cent recorded in 2017.

Skill mismatches have resulted in a labour

shortage and a need to import labour for

selected industries. In addition to skill gaps,

there is a large gap observed between the job

seekers’ expectations and the job requirements,

as the younger generations prefer non-routine

and cognitive jobs over routine and manual

jobs. Further, industries such as the construction

industry are perceived to be less attractive for

employment among potential job seekers mainly

due to the fragmented and temporary nature

of the work assignments. Hence, authorities

are compelled to import labour mainly from

China, India, Nepal and Myanmar to fulfill

the growing labour requirement in the rapidly

expanding construction industry. However,

long-term policy measures, such as automating

manufacturing processes as a means of moving

away from labour-intensive manufacturing, and

upskilling and reskilling the labour force could

be implemented instead of importing low-cost

labour.

As human capital has been identified

as one of the key enablers of the economic

development of a country, the efficient

utilisation of Sri Lanka’s large untapped

talent is essential. Hence, the government

could facilitate public-private partnerships to

upskill or reskill the existing labour force, while

ensuring school dropouts are attracted towards

government funded or donor funded skill

development programmes to build a sustainable

supply of skilled labour. Such skill development

programmes would lessen the skill gaps and

minimise the chances of youth performing less

productive jobs. Moreover, the government has

taken initiatives to increase the total years of

compulsory education to 13 years, with the main

objective of providing technical, vocational and

social skills to those who are not pursuing studies

after GCE O/L.

Foreign Employment

The total number of departures for foreign

employment declined marginally, despite the

increase in female departures. Accordingly,

male departures for foreign employment declined

by 6.8 per cent to 129,774 in 2018 from 139,268

in 2017. In contrast, female departures increased

by 12.3 per cent to 81,685 in 2018 from 72,724

in 2017, underpinned by the increase in female

departures under the housemaid category,

particularly in the age group of 35-44 years.

Even though the unskilled departures declined by

15.3 per cent in 2018, unskilled and housemaid

categories still represent 55.2 per cent share

of the total departures for foreign employment.

As many underage women are sent for employment

overseas by agencies through forged or fraudulent

documents, the government is considering the

introduction of new legislation to regulate foreign

employment and control human trafficking.

Sri Lanka could tap the growing market

of semi-skilled and skilled labour in various

disciplines while reducing the unskilled

departures. Disciplines such as nursing,

medicine, IT, finance, accounting, management,

engineering and industries such as tourism, sea

and air transportation, high-tech manufacturing,

construction, health care could be considered for

providing formal training to Sri Lankans seeking

foreign employment. To have an edge over

countries, such as the Philippines, Bangladesh,

India, Pakistan, China and other Asian countries,

Sri Lanka has to take necessary measures to

develop vocational and professional training

systems in line with international standards, to

strengthen the skilled labour supply to meet the

demands of the international market.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

136

The Middle East region continued to be

the main foreign employment destination for

Sri Lanka accounting for around 88.2 per cent

of the total departures. About 97.4 per cent

of housemaids and 78.0 per cent of unskilled

workers were concentrated in the Middle East

countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait

and the UAE. In terms of gender wise departures,

85.0 per cent of male departures and 93.3 per cent

of female departures were concentrated in the

Middle East region.

Foreign employment has a great impact

on the Sri Lankan economy due to private

worker remittances being one of the main

sources of foreign exchange earnings and

due to the significant role played in reducing

the unemployment and generating income that

reduces poverty. However, the over dependence

on private remittances poses threats to the

Sri Lankan economy due to possible variability in

labour demand in foreign labour markets resulting

from economic recessions, political unrests

and conflicts, policy changes restricting migrant

labour, automation and disruptive technology and

competition among labour exporting countries.

In addition, the social problems and social costs

associated with migration of females, human right

violations such as exploitation, non-payment or

under-payment and physical abuse, and the labour

shortages in several industries in Sri Lanka present

a strong case for reducing the over dependence

on worker remittances for improving foreign

exchange earnings. Accordingly, the strategic

direction for foreign employment requires a focus

on departures in the skilled and semi-skilled

categories, while reducing the total departures for

foreign employment especially in the housemaids

and unskilled categories.

The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign

Employment (SLBFE) continued to implement

measures to regulate the migration process,

and to protect and empower migrants

and their families. Accordingly, to ensure

trustworthy foreign employment for Sri Lankan

migrant workers, the SLBFE conducted 155 raids

on illegal recruitment activities and filed 213

court cases against illegal agencies and licensed

agencies that violated the law, in 2018. As

welfare and protection measures, the SLBFE

paid Rs. 138.25 million to an insurance company

on behalf of 211,093 migrant workers, incurred a

cost of Rs. 49.27 million in awarding scholarships

to 2,019 children of migrant workers, repatriated

a total of 25 migrant workers due to the problems

encountered during their stay abroad, utilising

Rs. 0.97 million of the Workers’ Welfare Fund

and the insurance scheme and settled 3,754

complaints received from migrant workers

regarding various problems. Further, the SLBFE

introduced the ‘National Vocational Qualification

Level 3’ as a mandatory requirement for

pre-departure training of Sri Lankans leaving for

employment in the Middle Eastern, European

and East Asian countries, such as Singapore,

Cyprus, Hong Kong and Maldives. In addition,

further measures have been taken to establish

Migrant Resource Centres in each province with

the view to improving the operations of the SLBFE

island-wide in facilitating the migrant workers.

Labour Relations and Labour Market Reforms

Labour relations in the private sector

deteriorated during 2018, since the number of

strikes increased significantly by 48.5 per cent

and the workers involved increased by

14.4 per cent. However, the number of man

days lost due to strikes declined by 14.4 per cent

during the year under review. Accordingly, 12,485

workers were involved in 49 strikes, resulting in a

loss of 51,423 man-days, in 2018. The increase

in the number of strikes and workers involved

were mainly due to the significant increase in

the number of strikes and workers involved in the

plantation sector. In contrast, the strikes reported in

semi government institutions and other private

institutions only increased marginally, by 4.8 per cent,

while the number of workers involved and man days

lost declined by 34.2 per cent and 66.5 per cent,

respectively. According to the publicly available

data, there were several strikes carried out by the

workers of public sector institutions, particularly

in health, education, postal and transportation

sectors.

Several measures were taken by the Ministry

of Labour and Trade Union Relations, during

2018, to improve workplace cooperation

and industrial harmony, together with the

introduction of several amendments and legal

provisions. Two amendments were brought into

the Maternity Benefits Ordinance No. 32 of 1939

and the Shop and Office Employees Act No. 19 of

1954 to extend maternity benefits for private sector

female employees. Accordingly, irrespective of

the number of children, 84 working days maternity

leave with pay shall be granted. Additionally,

legal provisions to provide feeding hours for

female employees were also introduced. The

administrative relaxation to practice a five day work

week for private sector manufacturing industries

was further extended in 2018. A committee was

appointed to revise the national minimum wage

in consultation with the National Labour Advisory

Council (NLAC). Further, cabinet approval was

granted to introduce a ‘Single Employment Law’

to address the issues related to anomalies and

discrepancies in existing labour laws with regard

to terms and conditions of employment in the

private sector. Legal provisions, to ensure full and

productive employment without any discrimination,

to prevent sexual harassments in the work place

and to introduce flexible working arrangements are

also to be included in the proposed act. Further,

cabinet approval was granted to cover domestic

workers through labour laws in order to protect

their rights. The ministry is also in the process of

taking necessary measures for the prevention

and elimination of forced labour. Furthermore, the

list of hazardous occupations was revised and is

expected to be submitted for cabinet approval. The

Social Dialogue Unit of the Department of Labour

conducted awareness programmes, workshops and

an all-island industrial level competition to improve

workplace cooperation and industrial peace in the

private sector. Further, the Department of Labour

initiated a ‘Social Dialogue Platform’ with the view

of reducing workplace disputes while increasing

productivity. In addition, actions were taken to

strengthen the dispute settlement system in order

to enhance industrial peace and harmony.

Labour Productivity

Labour productivity, measured in terms

of Gross Value Added (GVA) (in 2010 prices)

per hour worked, increased by 8.9 per cent to

Rs. 500.56 per hour worked in the first three

quarters of 2018, from Rs. 459.85 per hour

worked in the corresponding period of 2017.

This increase was mainly due to the decline in the

employed population, in addition to the incremental

increase in GVA. Accordingly, the labour productivity

in all three sectors, agriculture, industry and services

increased by 8.89 per cent, 10.43 per cent and

8.18 per cent, respectively, during the first three

quarters of 2018. However, labour productivity in the

agriculture sector was significantly low at Rs. 182.19

per hour worked for the first three quarters of 2018

as it still employs slightly more than one fourth of

the total employed population. Labour productivity

in industry and services sectors stood at Rs. 528.17

and Rs. 613.91 per hour worked, respectively, in

the first three quarters of 2018.

Improving labour productivity is important

for a country, as it is directly linked to the

improvement in standards of living in the form

of improved consumption, through production

of more goods and services with the same

amount of input. The subsidies provided have

hampered the productivity improvements in

the agriculture sector, with a large population

trapped in low productivity/ low income livelihood.

Therefore, in order to increase labour productivity

in the agriculture sector, focus should be on

technological adaption and advances, reviewing

land use and crop mix and implementation of more

productive practices. In addition, there should

be a reallocation of the labour concentrated in

the agriculture sector towards the industry and

services sectors to stimulate the economic growth,

to address labour shortages and to increase

overall labour productivity. The services sector

has proven to have the highest growth potential in

the economy. Overall, policies should be focused

on moving away from low productivity towards

higher productivity agriculture; from traditional

services to modern services, such as Information

and Communication Technology and Business

Process Management (ICT-BPM) and professional

services; and from manual or low technology

manufacturing to high technology manufacturing

in order to accelerate growth and generate higher

value employment.
