6.1 OverviewB

udgetary operations of the government

recorded progress with an enhanced

primary surplus and a lower budget

deficit, despite a decline in revenue mobilisation

during 2018. The surplus in the primary balance,

which reflects the difference between revenue and

grants, and non interest expenditure, increased

to 0.6 per cent of GDP (Rs. 91.4 billion) in 2018

from 0.02 per cent of GDP (Rs. 2.1 billion) in 2017.

A higher surplus in the primary balance is a salutary

development, as the government managed to meet

its non interest expenditure entirely out of revenue

receipts with a surplus remaining. However, this

was achieved largely through a compression in

capital expenditure, amidst a decline in revenue.

The revenue to GDP ratio declined to 13.3 per cent

in 2018 from 13.6 per cent in 2017 due to lower

tax revenue collections, mainly from import duties,

Value Added Tax (VAT), excise duty on importation

of petroleum products and liquor, withholding tax

and Cess levy, while the delay in implementing

certain measures announced in the Budget 2018

also affected the revenue collections in 2018.

Meanwhile, total expenditure and net lending

as a percentage of GDP also declined to 18.6

per cent during the year from 19.2 per cent in the

previous year due to a reduction in public investment.

Recurrent expenditure at 14.5 per cent of GDP in

2018 increased marginally due to higher interest

payments. Consequently, the current account deficit,

which reflects the difference between government

revenue and recurrent expenditure, increased to

1.2 per cent of GDP in 2018 from 0.7 per cent in 2017

reflecting dis-savings of the government.

However, the budget deficit declined to

5.3 per cent of GDP in 2018 from 5.5 per cent in

2017 due to the significant reduction in capital

expenditure. Nevertheless, the budget deficit

deviated from the target level of 4.8 per cent of

GDP envisaged in the Budget 2018. In financing

the budget deficit, the government relied largely

on domestic sources which accounted for

57.5 per cent of total financing in 2018. Within

domestic sources, financing from the non bank

sector increased while financing from the banking

sector declined. Outstanding central government

debt as a percentage of GDP increased to

82.9 per cent at end 2018 from 76.9 per cent at

end 2017 mainly reflecting the impact of the

depreciation of the rupee, relatively low nominal

GDP and higher net borrowings.

The enactment of the Active Liability

Management Act (ALMA) and the formulation

of a Medium Term Debt Management Strategy

(MTDS) would facilitate debt management of

the government, over the medium term. The

sharp rise in government debt underscores

the importance of the continuation of fiscal

consolidation measures, particularly ahead of an

election cycle. Any slippage from the envisaged

fiscal consolidation path could result in an

undermining of macroeconomic fundamentals

thereby weakening the investor sentiment. This

would intensify the refinancing risks of large debt

servicing obligations due over the medium term.

Major downside risks that emerged during 2018

include lower than expected revenue mobilisation,

a notable moderation in public investment and a

sharp increase in government debt, despite an

improvement in the primary balance and the

budget deficit. The low government revenue

resulting from delays in implementing revenue

enhancement measures, tax evasion, tax

avoidance and poor tax administration continued

to remain a major concern. As such, there is a

strong need for broadening the tax base through

robust revenue reforms, including the effective

implementation of the new Inland Revenue Act

and efforts to make revenue administration more

efficient while expediting the automation process

of major revenue collecting agencies. Planning

and monitoring should be strengthened to improve

the quality of public expenditure by focusing

on maximising rates of return and promoting

value for money through minimising leakages.

Reforms to state owned business enterprises

(SOBEs) should include the introduction of

cost recovery pricing mechanisms and other

appropriate measures needed to commercialise

major SOBEs, thereby enhancing their financial

viability.

6.2 Fiscal Policy Direction and Measures

In 2018, the fiscal policy strategy was

formulated with a view to strengthening the

fiscal consolidation process. Accordingly, fiscal

measures were aimed at enhancing revenue

collection and rationalising expenditure while

reforming and restructuring SOBEs in order to

contain the budget deficit and the outstanding

government debt at targeted levels. Accordingly,

the budget deficit and government debt for

2018 were targeted at 4.8 per cent of GDP and

77.4 per cent of GDP, respectively.

The new Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017,

which came into effect from 01 April 2018,

supported the revenue mobilisation effort of the

government by simplifying and rationalising

the existing income tax structure, broadening

the direct tax base and strengthening the

administrative powers, while introducing

international best practices to Sri Lanka’s tax

system. For employment income, the annual tax

free threshold was increased to Rs. 1.2 million from

Rs. 750,000 although the tax free threshold for

personal income tax was maintained at the same

level of Rs. 500,000. Further, tax slabs for personal

income tax, including employment income, were

widened by Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 600,000 brackets,

while the highest marginal tax rate was increased

to 24 per cent from 16 per cent. In addition, the new

Act streamlined the corporate income tax structure

to a three tier tax structure; a 40 per cent tax rate

for liquor, tobacco, and betting and gaming; a

28 per cent standard tax rate for banking, finance,

insurance and trading activities; and a 14 per cent

tax rate for all other sectors. Further, a Capital

Gains Tax was introduced at a rate of 10 per

cent on the realisation of capital assets, while the

withholding tax rate on interest earnings of resident

individuals was also increased to 5 per cent from

2.5 per cent. However, bank deposits of senior

citizens were exempted from the withholding tax

on interest income up to Rs. 1.5 million per annum.

Meanwhile, a new tax manual was published in April

2018 and training and awareness programmes were

conducted for professionals in the tax field and the

general public in order to enhance public awareness

of the new Act.

Several amendments were made to the VAT

and Nation Building Tax (NBT) Acts in 2018

in order to grant tax exemptions to identified

sectors with the aim of promoting activity in

such sectors, while a VAT refund scheme was

introduced for tourists to promote the tourism

sector. Accordingly, under the Value Added Tax

(Amendment) Act, No. 25 of 2018, exemptions were

granted for the supply of private medical services

other than hospital room charges to reduce the

medical costs. Further, supply of financial services

by the Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance Scheme,

local sale of certain garments by export oriented

companies and supply of infant milk powder, books,

magazines, journals and periodicals also exempted

from VAT. Further, under this VAT amendment, a

VAT refund scheme was also introduced for tourists.

Accordingly, the Tourist VAT Refund System

(TVRS) was established at the Bandaranaike

International Airport in September 2018 and thirty

one companies were registered under the TVRS.

In addition, several exemptions were granted

under the Nation Building Tax (Amendment) Act,

No. 20 of 2018 while the NBT exemption applicable

on liquor was removed during 2018.

Customs duty changes were made during

the year to reduce the applicable duty on fuel

imports in response to rising international fuel

prices and to discourage gold imports which

grew at a faster pace in the early part of the

year. Accordingly, in April 2018 a Customs duty

of 15 per cent was imposed on the importation of

gold, with a view to discouraging the excessive

gold imports observed in the preceding months.

The Customs duty and the duty waiver on the

importation of petrol and diesel were revised

with the introduction of the pricing formula for

fuel on 11 May 2018 and few more revisions

were made in 2018 and year to date in 2019.

Accordingly, Customs duty and the duty waiver

on the importation of petrol (92 Octane) stood at

Rs. 35 per litre and Rs. 19 per litre, respectively

at the end of January 2019. Similarly, for auto

diesel, the Customs duty and duty waiver

remained at Rs. 5.85 per litre and Rs. 3 per litre,

respectively. Further, Customs duties on petrol

(95 Octane) and super diesel were reduced to

Rs. 35 per litre and Rs. 10.55 per litre,

respectively, with the withdrawal of applicable

duty waivers. The applicable Customs duties

on fuel importation were reduced to ease

the adverse impact of rising international fuel

prices on domestic prices. At end March 2019,

Customs duties applicable on the importation

of auto diesel, super diesel, petrol (92 Octane)

and petrol (95 Octane) were Rs. 2.85 per litre,

Rs. 10.55 per litre, Rs. 16 per litre and Rs. 35 per

litre, respectively.

During the year, several revisions were made

to excise duty mainly aimed at curtailing the

importation of motor vehicles, which increased

significantly exerting pressure on the balance

of payments, and sweetened food items and

cigarettes due to health concerns. Accordingly,

the excise duty on motor vehicles with an engine

capacity less than 1,000 cm3 was revised upward

with effect from 01 August 2018. Further, following

the announcement of the Budget 2019 excise

duty on motor vehicles with engine capacity less

than 2,000 cm3 was increased with effect from 06

March 2019. However, excise duty on hearses,

hybrid and electric vans, single cabs and buddy

trucks with cargo carrying capacity less than 2,000

kg was reduced in March 2019 to facilitate the

SME sector and promote environmentally friendly

transport modes. In addition to the revisions in

excise duty, a luxury tax on motor vehicles was

proposed on the cost, insurance and freight (CIF)

value of imports or the manufacturer’s price in case

of domestic production in excess of a prescribed

tax free threshold with the aim of enhancing

revenue as well as curtailing import expenditure.

Meanwhile, revisions to the carbon tax were also

proposed. In 2018, an excise duty was imposed on

sugar imports while the excise duty on beverages

based on the sugar content of the product was

revised. Meanwhile, in March 2019 excise duty

on beverages was increased. With the aim of

encouraging domestic industries, the excise duty

on the importation of non-potable alcohol was

reduced to Rs. 6 per bulk kg from Rs. 15 per bulk

kg while importation of non-potable spirits by the

Board of Investment (BOI) approved companies

was exempted in 2018. Meanwhile, with effect

from 06 March 2019, excise duties on cigarettes

and liquor manufactured locally were increased

based on an indexation method with a minimum

annual duty increase reflecting annual inflation and

GDP growth, which would enhance government

revenue significantly. In addition, excise duty on

imported liquor was also increased with effect

from March 2019. Further, a license fee for toddy

tapping was imposed while the license fee for

bottling toddy was reduced to Rs. 500,000 from

Rs. 1,000,000. Meanwhile, in order to discourage

the consumption of cigarettes, the excise duty on

cigarettes was increased during the latter part of

the year. Further, the excise duty on auto diesel

was reduced to Rs. 6 per litre from Rs. 13 per litre

while the excise duty on kerosene was removed

in order to mitigate the volatility in fuel prices in

the domestic market, in response to rising global

petroleum prices.

The Special Commodity Levy (SCL) on

the importation of several food items was

revised from time to time during the year to

provide necessary protection for domestic

agricultural producers while reducing the

price volatility in the domestic market. The

SCL on the importation of vegetable oil was

revised upward twice during the year in June and

August 2018. Moreover, as a relief measure to

domestic consumers, the government announced

a reduction of the SCL applicable on several

essential items including, dhal, chickpeas and

peas with effect from November 2018, while

the SCL on potatoes and b’onion was reduced

with effect from December 2018. In addition, the

SCL on the importation of maize and potatoes

was revised upward in February 2019 in order

to provide protection for domestic farmers.

Further, in line with the government policy on

trade liberalisation, the Cess and the Ports and

Airports Development Levy (PAL) on 253 items

were removed in 2018 as proposed in the Budget

2018, which would facilitate strategically important

sectors, such as tourism and other value added

industries. Meanwhile, the Cess on a number of

items was also removed in March 2019, while

the Cess on construction material was reduced

to facilitate the construction industry.

Measures to strengthen tax administration,

including the Revenue Administration

Management Information System (RAMIS)

and National Single Window (NSW) continued

during the year aimed at improving revenue

mobilisation through an expansion of the

tax base and enhanced tax compliance.

Accordingly, the RAMIS of the Inland Revenue

Department (IRD) was upgraded in order to

incorporate the provisions of the Inland Revenue

Act, No. 24 of 2017. The RAMIS monitors all

tax categories except ESC, stamp duty and

the betting and gaming levy. VAT on financial

services and personal income tax registrations

were included in the RAMIS system during the

year. Several programmes were also conducted

to enhance the public awareness of RAMIS.

This together with new registrations resulted in

an increase in the number of registered tax files

in IRD. Moreover, the IRD started to implement

organisational and business procedure reforms

to modernise tax administration. These included;

the restructuring of the IRD along functional

lines; creating a Design and Monitoring Unit; a

more efficient management structure to speed

up interaction with taxpayers; strengthening the

Large Taxpayer Unit; introducing mandatory

e-filing; and enhancing the use of taxpayer

identification numbers. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka

Customs initiated measures to establish a NSW

to facilitate importers and exporters.

On the expenditure front, several measures

were introduced to improve the monitoring

process of government expenditure, ensuring

better management of public expenditure

given the limited fiscal space available for

social expenditure and public investment.

Accordingly, the quarterly expenditure and

income outcome report for the first quarter

of 2018 was presented to the Parliament as

announced in the Budget 2017, in order to

strengthen the Parliamentary control over public

finances. In addition, quarterly budget estimates

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

195

were presented to the Parliament for the first time

in the Budget 2018. Accordingly, under the State

Accounts Circular No. 263/2017, all spending

agencies were instructed to prepare their annual

budgets on a quarterly basis for 2018 in order

to ensure the systematic utilisation of annual

budgetary provisions. Moreover, guidelines

were issued under the National Budget Circular

No. 03/2018 to streamline the motor vehicle

procurement process of Ministries, Departments

and other government institutions. A Vote on

Account (VoA) for the first four months of 2019

was approved by Parliament on 21 December

2018, due to the time limitation for submitting a

fresh Appropriation Bill for 2019 for Parliamentary

approval, following the political developments

that occurred during the latter part in 2018. The

Budget 2019 which was formulated based on the

guidelines in the National Budget Circular No.

4/2018, within the Performance Based Budgeting

(PBB) approach, was presented to Parliament

on 05 March 2019. The Integrated Treasury

Management Information System (ITMIS) at

the Ministry of Finance (MOF) contributed to

modernise the Public Financial Management

(PFM) in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, ITMIS was used

in the preparation of the Budget 2019. Awareness

workshops were conducted island-wide in order

to educate public officials on ITMIS.

During the year, efficiency of service

delivery on pension payments was enhanced

through an automated process, while pension

anomalies are expected to be rectified and

public sector salaries increased with effect

from 2019. Under the Public Administration

Circular No. 07/2018, guidelines were issued to

enhance the efficiency of the pension payment

process. Accordingly, instructions were issued to

establish a Pension Division in large institutions

and to prepare a database including information

on employees who reach the age of retirement,

if such a database was not already available.

Further, under the Pension Circular No. 09/2015

(Revision III), steps were taken to provide death

gratuity payments via an online system with effect

from 01 June 2018. Moreover, arrangements

were made to introduce an online system to

collect applications for the Widows’/Widowers’

and Orphans’ contributions, with effect from 30

June 2018. Further, under the Pension Circular

No. 01/2018, initiatives were undertaken to

improve and formalise the payment procedure

for pensioners who reside abroad enabling them

to receive their pension payment on the due

date. Under the Public Administration Circular

No. 08/2018, a decision was taken to pay

compensation to dependents of any deceased

public officer, irrespective of whether the officer

held a permanent and pensionable post, if the

officer passed away while engaged in hazardous

employment or carrying out official duties. The

Budget 2019 proposed measures to rectify the

pension anomalies as there is a disparity of

pensions drawn by pensioners who have retired

before 01 January 2016. Therefore, a revision

will be made incorporating the first 2 phases of

the Public Administration Circular No. 03/2016

to the basic salary obtained by the pensioner,

at the time of retirement, with effect from 01

July 2019. Further, an interim allowance of

Rs. 2,500 per month will also be paid to public

sector employees with effect from 01 July 2019.

Although public investment declined

during the year, the government implemented

several infrastructure projects to address

the critical infrastructure needs in both

urban areas as well as lagging regions.

Accordingly, in 2018, the government invested

in road construction, rehabilitation and land

acquisition with a view to improving the transport

network of the country and mitigating traffic

congestion. The multi purpose development

project in Moragahakanda was vested to the

public in January 2018, while the filling of water

into the Kalu Ganga reservoir commenced in

July 2018 with the aim of facilitating agricultural

activities in the Northern, North Central, North

Western, Central and Eastern provinces.

Infrastructure development in the education

sector during the year was channelled towards

the development of both human resources and

physical infrastructure under “the Nearest School

is the Best School (NSBS)” Programme while

rehabilitating the schools affected by floods and

landslides. Meanwhile, the construction of two

new national schools commenced in Kurunagala

and Polonnaruwa in 2018. In addition, during

the year the government launched a Rapid

Rural Development Programme (RRDP) named

“Gamperaliya” in order to improve the quality of

infrastructure and to upgrade the living standards

of the people, while supporting villages to become

growth centers. The “Gamperaliya” programme,

which commenced in 2018 covers twelve

development areas1 across the country. The

National Agency for Public Private Partnerships

(NAPPP) reviewed and finalised guidelines for

public private partnerships (PPPs) in consultation

with the MOF, with a view to promoting PPPs as a

national strategy in addressing the infrastructure

requirements of the country.

The government continued its welfare

programmes for the economically vulnerable

groups, while also taking measures to

rationalise subsidy programmes. The main

welfare schemes included the Samurdhi

programme, fertiliser subsidy, financial support

1 Tanks and anicuts, road sector infrastructure, construction of small scale bridges, school sanitary facilities, sports related infrastructure improvements, other socio-economic in-frastructure development, development of “Sathi Pola”, construction of children’s parks, provision of electricity facilities for needy households, rehabilitation of temples, kovils, churches and mosques, setting up of solar power facilities for religious places, housing development in rural and urban areas.

for elderly over 70 years of age, support for low

income disabled persons, financial support for

kidney patients, nutrition food programmes, free

text books and free season tickets for students.

With a view to improving maternal and child

nutrition, programmes such as the nutritional food

package for expectant mothers, the Thriposha

programme and school nutrition programmes were

continued during the year. The Welfare Benefits

Board (WBB), which was established to provide

the necessary legal framework and transparent

selection process for all welfare related benefits

in Sri Lanka, drafted welfare benefits payment

schemes for the four main welfare programmes2

and submitted it to the Cabinet of Ministers in

October 2018. Further, the WBB was engaged

in developing the selection methodology of the

welfare payment schemes. In addition, actions

were taken to establish the integrated Social

Registry Information System (SRIS), which is an

electronic database that will store data of welfare

beneficiaries of different programmes, mainly for

the purpose of selection and payment of welfare

benifits. Meanwhile, a decision was taken by

the Cabinet of Ministers, in March 2018, to

terminate the cash grant of the fertiliser subsidy

programme and replace it with the provision of

fertiliser to farmers, to avoid issues that arose in

implementing the cash grant policy. Accordingly,

an approved amount of fertiliser was provided to

farmers at a concessionary price of Rs. 500 per

50 kg bag for paddy and Rs. 1,500 per 50 kg

bag in respect of other crops (such as potatoes,

onions, capsicum, corn and soya) from the Yala

season in 2018 onwards.

performance reports for the first half of 2017 of

the five SOBEs which had signed Statements

of Corporate Intent (SCIs) in March 2017 were

forwarded to the Cabinet of Ministers in May

2018. It is expected that ten more SOBEs3 will

sign SCIs in the near future in order to improve

the efficiency of their operations. Further, the

approval of the Cabinet of Ministers was granted

in May 2018 to implement the formula based

fuel pricing mechanism in order to improve

the financial viability of the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation (CPC), while ensuring transparency

in petroleum pricing. Consequently, the formula

based price adjustments were in effect from May

2018 on a monthly basis to bring fuel prices in line

with cost recovery levels. Moreover, the approval

of the Cabinet of Ministers was expected to be

obtained for an automatic pricing mechanism

for electricity in 2019, in order to improve the

financial performance of the Ceylon Electricity

Board (CEB). A Bulk Supply Transaction

Account (BSTA)4 was established in May 2018

as a precondition for the implementation of the

automatic pricing mechanism for electricity.

Further, approval was granted by the Cabinet of

Ministers in March 2019 to implement a pricing

mechanism for Liquefied Petroleum (LP) gas is

also expected to be established.

Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS)

was in progress. The public debt management

was further strengthened through the ALMA,

which was passed by Parliament in March

2018 enabling the government to manage the

public debt more proactively by addressing

part of the refinancing requirements ahead of

time (reducing rollover peaks) and extending

the maturity duration and smoothening the

repayment structure of International Sovereign

Bonds (ISBs) and other debt securities. In

general, liability management would help the

government to diversify the investor base, provide

opportunities to streamline the cost of borrowing

based on market conditions, reduce refinancing

risks in the near term and create a favourable

price guidance on new issuances. Moreover,

the ALMA would enable the Central Bank and

the government to initiate liability management

exercises in the domestic and foreign market in

the form of building buffers, switching, buy-backs

and reverse auctions. The MTDS would mainly

focus on containing the foreign exposure of the

central government debt profile while extending

the average time to maturity in order to minimise

any refinancing risks while lowering government

debt to sustainable levels.

Several initiatives were taken by the Central

Bank during the year to improve transparency

and efficiency in the government securities

market. The new Treasury bond issuance

system, which was introduced in July 2017,

was reviewed at the end of the first quarter of

2018 taking its performance into account and

the feedback from market participants assisted

in enhancing the efficiency and transparency

of the issuance process. Further, in view of the

increased volatility in global financial markets, the

Central Bank reduced the threshold for foreign

investment in rupee denominated government

securities from 10 per cent of the outstanding

government securities stock to 5 per cent with

effect from 18 January 2019.

The government raised US dollars 4.9

billion through the issuance of ISBs during

2018 and so far during 2019. In April 2018, the

government issued the 12th ISB, which was the

largest offshore bond offering ever by Sri Lanka

and raised US dollars 2.5 billion. This issue

comprised two ISBs of US dollars 1.25 billion

each with a 5 year maturity at a yield rate of

5.75 per cent and a 10 year maturity at a yield

rate of 6.75 per cent. In March 2019, the 13th

ISB amounting to US dollars 2.4 billion was

issued with two tenures of maturity amounting to

US dollars 1.0 billion with a 5 year maturity at

a yield rate of 6.85 per cent and US dollars 1.4

billion with a 10 year maturity at a yield rate of

7.85 per cent per annum. In addition, a Foreign

Currency Term Financing Facility (FCTFF) of

US dollars 1.0 billion was obtained in October

2018.

The primary balance target - Quantitative

Performance Criteria (QPC) set under the

the International Monetary Fund’s Extended

Fund Facility (IMF-EFF) programme - was

achieved by the Government for end June

2018. The three-year IMF-EFF programme

was obtained in June 2016 with the aim of

strengthening the country’s external sector while

supporting the government’s economic reform

agenda. The programme included a reform

agenda aimed at rebuilding foreign exchange

reserves and reducing the fiscal deficit to contain

the debt accumulation while restoring overall

macroeconomic stability. Although, the QPC in

respect of the primary balance for the period

January-June 2018 was achieved recording

Rs. 45.6 billion, the December QPC target of Rs.

141 billion was missed by Rs. 49.6 billion.

The sovereign credit ratings for Sri Lanka

were revised by international sovereign rating

agencies in 2018. On 06 February 2018, Fitch

affirmed Sri Lanka’s long-term foreign and local

currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at “B+” with

a “stable” outlook. Meanwhile, Moody’s Investor

Services also affirmed Sri Lanka’s sovereign

rating at “B1” and maintained the “negative”

outlook on 26 July 2018, while Standard and

Poor’s (S&P) long term rating stood at “B+”

with a “stable” outlook. However, following the

increased political uncertainty towards the end of

2018, major rating agencies revised the country’s

sovereign ratings. Accordingly, Moody’s Investor

Services (Moody’s) on 20 November 2018

revised Sri Lanka’s sovereign rating downward

to B2 (Stable) from B1 (Negative). In addition,

both Standard and Poor’s and Fitch Ratings

lowered Sri Lanka’s sovereign rating from ‘B+’

(Stable) to ‘B’ (Stable) on 04 December 2018

and 21 December 2018, respectively. Such

downgrading could also be attributed to the

perceived heightened external refinancing risks,

an uncertain policy outlook and the risk of a

slowdown in fiscal consolidation arising from the

political uncertainty, which prevailed at the time.

Although some progress was made in

improving fiscal balances in comparison to the

previous year, the government deviated from

the key fiscal targets stipulated in the Budget

2018. Despite several revenue and expenditure

reform measures initiated in the recent past,

underperformance in revenue collection and

rigidity in expenditure rationalisation have resulted

in budgetary outcomes deviating from envisaged

fiscal targets. A reduction in capital expenditure

on economic and social infrastructure to offset

any recurrent expenditure overruns would be

undesirable as it could dampen economic growth

prospects. Interest payments continued to be

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

the single largest item in recurrent expenditure,

while public sector salaries and wages exerted

pressure on expenditure management. The

changes in the demographic profile, coupled with

the substantial increase in the size of the public

sector, have resulted in an increase in pension

payments, which accounted for a significant

share (9.3 per cent) of recurrent expenditure.

The high level of transfer payments and

expenditure on welfare payments also continued

to weigh on the government budget. As such,

persistently high recurrent expenditure resulted

in deviating the fiscal performance substantially

from the stipulated targets thereby highlighting

the need for further rationalisation of recurrent

expenditure. In addition, unplanned expenditure

emanating from increased incidence of natural

disasters (e.g. compensation and mitigation

costs due to the floods, droughts and damage

caused by the Fall Armyworm (‘Sena” Catepillar)

exerted additional pressure on managing public

expenditure. This underscores the importance

of implementing contingency budgeting against

weather-related natural disasters as well as

mainstreaming sustainability into planning and

budgeting processes. The high level of recurrent

expenditure over and above the total revenue

of the government and the resultant budget

deficit would expand the government’s financing

requirements impacting adversely on the debt

management efforts of the government. Moreover,

a rise in foreign borrowings will increase the

country’s external vulnerability to risks such as

tightening global financial market conditions. At

the same time, an over reliance on domestic

sources could result in an upward pressure

on domestic interest rates, particularly amidst

tighter liquidity conditions thereby escalating the

public debt level, which remains high compared

to peers. In such a context, maintaining fiscal

discipline by adhering to binding fiscal rules would

be imperative to achieve targeted outcomes in

the fiscal consolidation process.

The efforts towards increasing revenue

mobilisation would be essential to achieve

revenue targets over the medium term.

Improving tax compliance, eliminating loopholes

leading to tax evasion and tax avoidance,

strengthening risk based VAT audits at the IRD

and rationalisation of tax exemptions would

be major priorities in broadening the tax base

and thereby enhancing revenue collection.

Rationalisation of ineffective public expenditure,

restructuring of SOBEs and introducing market

based pricing mechanisms in order to enable

SOBEs to operate as commercially viable

entities and efficient targeting of transfers and

subsidies would be required to improve the

quality of public expenditure, while making

space for critical social expenditure and public

investment. As an ageing population remains

a key concern, it is essential to take necessary

measures to ensure the sustainability of the

unfunded public sector pension scheme. A bill

on new Public Financial Management (PFM) is to

be submitted to Parliament, aimed at improving

the budget process, identifying fiscal risks,

improving fiscal transparency and accountability

of the government operations. Stabilising the

government debt level on a sustainable path

requires a sufficiently large primary surplus to

be generated over the medium term. A carefully

crafted medium-term debt management strategy

would be needed to steer the country away from

the refinancing risks. Further, developing political

consensus and raising public awareness are

paramount in achieving targets stipulated in the

fiscal consolidation path as fiscal consolidation

would invariably be politically challenging without

unwavering public support.

Introduction

Sri Lanka’s government debt has been on a steadily rising trend since independence. The government debt to GDP ratio grew at an annual average of 2.8 per cent during 1950-2018, and compared to the growth of country’s nominal income, which averaged around 4.5 per cent during the same period, such expansion of government debt is concerning. Such growth in government debt reflects the impact of sustained fiscal deficits, restricted access to concessional financing with the gradual rise in per capita income, and the depreciation of the exchange rate. Due to the limited availability of concessional funding, foreign currency financing tilted further towards commercial borrowings by means of International Sovereign Bonds, syndicated loans, and short-term borrowings from the foreign currency banking units of domestic banks, resulting in a significant increase of the share of foreign currency debt in the total outstanding debt.

As Figure B 8.1 shows government debt stock, which stood at 16.9 per cent of GDP at end 1950, increased steadily over time, peaking above 100 per cent of GDP on a few occasions before moderating to 68.7 per cent at end 2012. However, another upward trend in government debt has emerged since 2013 to reach at 82.9 per cent by end 2018.

Recognising the importance of containing the level of government debt at a sustainable level, the Government has embarked on a revenue based fiscal consolidation strategy, where it aims at reducing the debt to GDP ratio below 70 per cent over the medium term. A major element in the government’s medium term fiscal

BOX 8Maintaining a Sufficient Primary Surplus to Ensure a Sustainable Debt Level over the Medium Term

strategy is the envisaged surplus in the primary balance, which was achieved for the first time since 1992 and continued for the second consecutive year since 2017. The primary surplus plays a critical role in decelerating the pace of debt accumulation as it helps to fund a part of refinancing obligations instead of shifting the entire burden of debt servicing obligations on future borrowings.

The primary balance of the budget is defined as the fiscal balance net of interest payments and is considered as a key determinant of the government debt dynamics (Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2014, IMF and Panchanan, 2016, ADBI). A deficit in the primary balance is equal to the difference between revenue and non interest expenditure. It determines the extent of borrowings by the government for its expenditures other than the interest payments. The theoretical relationship between the debt level and primary balance together with other key variables can be summarised by a debt dynamic equation.

Dynamics of Government Debt

Based on the budget constraint, the change in the debt stock of a country in the current year can be expressed in the following equation (1) by combining the major variables that affect the stock of debt:

Moreover, if the government achieves a sufficient primary surplus to meet the interest payments given the other factors, then the debt to GDP ratio will be stabilised at the existing level, reflecting the fact that there would not be new borrowings beyond the roll-over requirement of capital payments. If the primary surplus further increases, then the debt to GDP ratio would be falling over time and vice versa.

Behaviour of the Debt Dynamics in Sri Lanka

In an open economy, the behaviour of major macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, real interest rates and exchange rates provide valuable inputs for debt sustainability analysis.3 As Figure B 8.2 depicts the subdued economic growth, high real interest rates,4 notable depreciation of the rupee, and persistent primary deficits have resulted in an increase in the debt to GDP ratio since economic liberalisation through the early 2000s. However, the increasing trend in debt to GDP was reversed since 2001 through 2008, which could mainly be explained by relatively high GDP growth, negative or low real interest rates and relatively stable exchange rates and lower primary deficits. Meanwhile, the rise in debt to GDP ratio since 2009 is reflected by the combined impact of lower GDP growth, higher real interest rates and a higher primary deficit on account of increased non-interest expenditure in the post-conflict development activities. Further, since 2010, the primary balance improved, except in 2014 and 2015 partly contributing to the reduction of debt to GDP ratio below 80 per cent by end 2017.

However, in spite of the surplus in the primary balance of 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2018, the deb to GDP ratio increased to 82.9 per cent at end 2018, reflecting mainly the impact of sharp rupee depreciation, relatively low economic growth and high real interest rates.

Debt Stabilising Primary Balance for Sri Lanka over the Medium Term

A major task in the debt stabilsation exercise is the determination of the right level of primary surplus, which could deliver the envisaged reduction in the stock of debt over time. An approach has been proposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) using the Stress Tests developed based on the debt dynamic equation (2). Accordingly, a debt stabilising primary balance can be ascertained given the assumptions on the other variables that affect the path of debt dynamics. As such, a primary surplus that ensures a credible decline in the government’s debt to GDP ratio along the path envisaged by the Government over the medium term is calculated under three scenarios of different rates of GDP growth, interest rates and currency depreciation. The projections are made for the period of 2019-2023 and assumptions of other variables based on current market conditions as shown in the Table B 8.1.

The results indicate that the Government needs to maintain a primary surplus in the range of 1.9-2.4 per cent of GDP during 2019-2023 to bring the debt to GDP ratio below 70 per cent of GDP by end 2023, under the baseline scenario that assumes a modest rate of depreciation of the rupee. In addition, three different scenarios were considered, giving a 10 per cent shock on the growth rate (scenario I), interest rate (scenario II) and exchange rate depreciation (scenario III) (Figure B 8.3). Under the scenario I, in the event of

a negative growth shock the required primary surplus to reduce the government debt to 70 percent of GDP increases to the range of 2.2 – 2.8 per cent of GDP. Under the scenario II, following the shock to the interest rate, the required primary surplus increases to the range of 2.1 – 2.7 percent of GDP. Under the scenario III, the shock to the rate of depreciation increases the required primary balance to the range of 1.9 – 2.5 percent of GDP. As such, results indicate that the impact of shocks to economic growth on the required primary balance is more significant, than the shocks to interest rate and exchange rate. Hence, the results underscore the importance of the role of the interest rate and growth differential in determining the required level of primary balance for debt stabilisation. In such context, the Government may need to maintain a large primary surplus, if the gap between the interest rate and GDP growth widens over time. According to the IMF Country Report (Article IV) - June 2018, the projected primary surplus target in the medium term is 2.0-2.1 per cent of GDP. As per the medium term fiscal framework (2018-2023) of the government, the Government aims to maintain a primary surplus in the range of 1.5-2.8 per cent over 2020-2023. Hence, the values derived from Stress Tests are comparable with the IMF and Government projections.

Way Forward

Stabilisation of the government debt to GDP ratio and subsequently putting it on a declining path requires a sufficiently large primary surplus to be generated over the medium term if the interest rate-growth differential is positive. Such a primary surplus should be driven mainly by robust revenue enhancement, in line with the ongoing revenue based fiscal consolidation framework. However,

the progression along the envisaged primary balance path would appear challenging, if the actual collection of government revenue falls short of estimates, as was mostly seen in the recent years. On the expenditure front, rationalisation of non-interest recurrent expenditure is often challenging due to the growing recurrent expenditure, on the heel of large commitment on public sector salaries and wages, subsidies and social welfare programmes, and the costs associated with natural disasters.

It is also observed that the recent experience of ensuring a primary surplus amidst falling government revenue and rigid non-interest recurrent expenditure has been made possible by a significant deceleration in public investment. As Figure B 8.4 shows, the public investments as a share of GDP has been falling during the recent years, from 5.5 per cent in 2015 to 4.3 per cent in 2018 while the primary surplus has been improving from a deficit of 2.9 percent in 2015 to 0.6 per cent in 2018. If the primary surplus is mainly supported by a reduction in public investment instead of robust revenue reforms, such an outcome would compromise the growth prospects of the economy, hence would be unsustainable over the medium term. The lower level of public investment would hamper the economic growth, thereby affecting the debt dynamics, through interest rate and growth differential, among other factors. Hence, targeting a higher primary surplus while also planning for large public investment would be challenging for Sri Lanka over the medium term. Therefore, a right level of primary balance needs to consider a more realistic level of revenue mobilisation and a prudent level of expenditure management, aimed at gradual deceleration of government debt level.

6.3 Government Budgetary Operations

Revenue and Grants

Revenue

During 2018, total revenue as a per cent

of GDP declined due to the reduction in tax

revenue despite an increase in non tax revenue.

Accordingly, total government revenue declined

to 13.3 per cent from 13.6 per cent in 2017. Tax

revenue declined to 11.9 per cent of GDP in 2018

from 12.4 per cent in 2017 as a result of the lower

revenue collection from import duties, VAT, excise

duty on petroleum products and liquor, withholding

tax and Cess levy and the delay in implementing

certain revenue measures in the Budget 2018,

particularly revisions related to the Finance

Act. However, non tax revenue increased to

1.4 per cent of GDP in 2018 from 1.2 per cent

recorded in the previous year due to the Central

Bank profit transfers and the increase in revenue

from fees and charges.

In nominal terms, total revenue increased

by 4.8 per cent to Rs. 1,920.0 billion in 2018

from Rs. 1,831.5 billion in 2017. Tax revenue

increased by 2.5 per cent to Rs. 1,712.3 billion from

Rs. 1,670.2 billion in 2017 reflecting a growth in

revenue from corporate and non corporate income

taxes, Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) tax, Economic

Service Charge (ESC) and PAL. The revenue

collection from VAT, NBT and excise duty on motor

vehicles, cigarettes and liquor also increased in

nominal terms, although revenue as a percentage

of GDP declined in these categories. However,

the revenue collection from import duties, excise

duty on petroleum products, withholding tax and

the Cess levy declined during the year in nominal

terms. Revenue from indirect taxes continued to

be the major contributor to the government coffers

accounting for 81.9 per cent of total tax revenue in

2018. However, the share of revenue from direct

taxes increased to 18.1 per cent during the year

from 16.4 per cent in the previous year, reflecting

mainly the impact of the implementation of the

new Inland Revenue Act with effect from 01 April

As such, it is imperative that the improvements in fiscal operations of the government need to be achieved through the revenue based fiscal consolidation. In this regard, it is required to increase the government revenue further by way of broadening the tax base and structural reforms in tax administration while taking measures for rationalizing recurrent expenditure. The government’s continuous commitment towards the revenue based fiscal consolidation will expand the fiscal space and allow for more spending on growth drivers in the medium term, while increasing infrastructure spending and effective fiscal outlay for key social

spending categories and thereby influencing economic growth. In addition to the gradual increase in the path of envisaged economic growth, maintaining the interest rates and exchange at relatively stable levels would be essential to secure a sufficient primary surplus, thereby ensuring a sustainable debt level over the medium term.

2018. Meanwhile, non tax revenue increased to

Rs. 207.7 billion in 2018 from Rs. 161.4 billion in

2017 resulting in the share of tax revenue in total

revenue declining to 89.2 per cent in 2018 from

91.2 per cent in 2017.

Revenue from income taxes increased

during the year both in terms of GDP and in

nominal terms due to the increase in revenue

collection from corporate and non corporate

income taxes, PAYE tax and ESC. Accordingly,

as a percentage of GDP revenue from income

taxes increased marginally to 2.1 per cent in

2018 from 2.0 per cent in 2017 while in nominal

terms the income tax revenue collection increased

significantly by 13.1 per cent to Rs. 310.4 billion

during the year from Rs. 274.6 billion in the

previous year. Revenue from corporate and non

corporate income taxes increased by 18.1 per

cent to Rs. 169.6 billion in 2018 from Rs. 143.6

billion in 2017 mainly due to the implementation

of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017 with

effect from 01 April 2018 and the strengthening

of the payment and return monitoring process by

the IRD. Revenue from PAYE tax also improved

during the year by 25.7 per cent to Rs. 41.4

billion from Rs. 32.9 billion in 2017, largely due to

improvements in the monitoring process related

to the submission of PAYE returns and payments

with the initiation of the RAMIS system. Moreover,

revenue from ESC increased by 18.5 per cent to

Rs. 53.0 billion in 2018 due to the imposition of

ESC on the importation of motor vehicles based

on the payable excise duty and the imposition of

ESC on a share of one tenth of the turnover of the

wholesale supply of fuel since September 2018.

Further, the revenue collection from Capital Gains

Tax (CGT) amounted to Rs. 104.0 million in 2018.

However, revenue from withholding tax declined

by 13.0 per cent to Rs. 46.4 billion in 2018 from

Rs. 53.3 billion in 2017 as a result of the removal of

withholding tax on interest income of Treasury bills

and Treasury bonds, with effect from 01 April 2018.

Although revenue from VAT as a percentage

of GDP declined marginally in 2018, it increased

in nominal terms during the year. Accordingly,

as a per cent of GDP, revenue from VAT declined

to 3.2 per cent of GDP, while in nominal terms VAT

revenue increased by 4.1 per cent to Rs. 461.7

billion mainly as a result of the rise in imports such

as coal, milk powder, cement and lubricants and

the removal of VAT exemptions on a number of

items. Further, monitoring of payments and receipts

with the implementation of RAMIS, increased

tax audits strengthening the tax administration

process of the IRD which supported this growth

in nominal terms. The revenue collection from

VAT on domestic economic activities increased

by 2.6 per cent to Rs. 282.6 billion in 2018 from

Rs. 275.4 billion in 2017. Meanwhile, revenue from

VAT on import related activities also increased

during the year by 6.4 per cent to Rs. 179.2 billion.

Accordingly, VAT revenue as a per cent of total tax

revenue increased marginally during the year to

27.0 per cent from 26.6 per cent in 2017. However,

the contribution of VAT revenue to total revenue

declined marginally to 24.0 per cent in 2018 from

24.2 per cent in 2017.

Revenue from excise duties declined as

a per cent of GDP in 2018 although reflecting

an increase in nominal terms. Accordingly,

revenue from excise duties as a percentage of

GDP declined to 3.4 per cent during the year from

3.5 per cent in the previous year. However, in

nominal terms, the revenue collection from excise

duties increased by 3.1 per cent to Rs. 484.3 billion

from Rs. 469.5 billion mainly due to the increase

in the revenue from excise duty on motor vehicles

and cigarettes amidst the decline in revenue from

the excise duty on petroleum products. During

early 2018, excise duty from the importation of

motor vehicles increased substantially compared

to 2017 as a result of a rise in the importation of

motor vehicles, although during the latter part of

the year vehicle imports declined on account of

measures taken by the government and the Central

Bank to reduce imports. Accordingly, annual

revenue collection from the excise duty on motor

vehicles increased to Rs. 204.1 billion in 2018 from

Rs. 189.7 billion in 2017. Moreover, revenue from

excise duty on cigarettes and tobacco increased

by 7.3 per cent to Rs. 92.2 billion mainly due to

the increase in excise duty rates on cigarettes in

mid 2018. Revenue from excise duty on liquor

recorded a marginal increase of 0.2 per cent to

Rs. 113.9 billion in 2018 due to the increase in

soft liquor production. Meanwhile, revenue from

the excise duty on petroleum products declined by

10.4 per cent to Rs. 66.3 billion due to the

decline in diesel imports during the year and the

reduction of excise duty on the importation of auto

diesel during the latter part of 2018. Revenue

collection from excise duties remained the single

largest contributor to total tax revenue in 2018,

while the share of excise tax revenue in total tax

revenue increased to 28.3 per cent in 2018 from

28.1 per cent recorded in the previous year.

In nominal terms, the revenue collection from

import duties was lower in 2018 while revenue

from SCL increased in comparison to 2017.

Revenue from import duties declined during the

year reflecting the reduction in applicable duty rates

on petrol, diesel and milk powder and the decline

in diesel imports. Accordingly, revenue from import

duties as a per cent of GDP declined to 0.7 per cent

in 2018, from 1.0 per cent in 2017 and in nominal

terms, revenue from import duties declined by

28.9 per cent to Rs. 97.0 billion in 2018. The share

of import duty in tax revenue decelerated during

2018 to 5.7 per cent from 8.2 per cent recorded

in 2017. Meanwhile, revenue from SCL increased

in nominal terms by 6.2 per cent to Rs. 75.8 billion

from Rs. 71.4 billion as a result of the increase

in SCL rates applicable on several commodities.

The share of SCL in tax revenue increased to

4.4 per cent in 2018 from 4.3 per cent in the

previous year.

The revenue collection from other taxes

showed a mixed performance during the year.

Accordingly, revenue from PAL recorded an

increase of 11.3 per cent to Rs. 114.0 billion in 2018

from Rs. 102.4 billion in 2017 in response to the

increase in the importation of several intermediate

goods which were subject to PAL. However,

revenue from the Cess levy decreased during the

year by 10.4 per cent to Rs. 53.4 billion in 2018

from Rs. 59.6 billion in 2017 owing to the removal

of Cess on 253 imported items in the 2018 Budget

with a view of phasing out para tariffs applicable

on the importation of several goods. Revenue

from NBT increased in nominal terms by 3.4 per

cent to Rs. 71.4 billion during the year due to the

increase in both domestic economic activities

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

206

and import related activities. Accordingly, NBT

revenue from import related economic activities

increased by 4.4 per cent to Rs. 20.2 billion

while revenue from domestic economic activities

increased by 3.0 per cent to Rs. 51.2 billion

during the year. However, as a percentage of

GDP, revenue from NBT remained unchanged

at 0.5 per cent as in the previous year. Revenue

from the Telecommunication Levy declined by

15.2 per cent to Rs. 28.3 billion in comparison

to Rs. 33.4 billion in 2017, due to the removal of

taxes on internet services coupled with the drop

in call duration.

Non tax revenue increased in 2018 both in

terms of GDP and in nominal terms. Accordingly,

non tax revenue as a per cent of GDP increased

to 1.4 per cent in 2018 from 1.2 per cent in 2017,

while in nominal terms, non tax revenue increased

by 28.7 per cent to Rs. 207.7 billion in 2018 from

Rs. 161.4 billion in 2017 mainly due to Central

Bank profit transfers and increased revenue from

fees and charges. In 2018, revenue generated

through Central Bank profit transfers was

Rs. 15.0 billion. In addition, revenue from fees and

charges increased by 51.8 per cent to Rs. 101.1

billion from Rs. 66.6 billion recorded in 2017 due

to upward revisions of fees and charges in the

2018 Budget. Meanwhile, revenue from rent and

interest income increased by 15.9 per cent to

Rs. 13.7 billion in 2018. Revenue from social

security contributions increased by 9.9 per cent

to Rs. 25.2 billion in 2018 from Rs. 22.9 billion

in 2017 mainly due to the increase in the basic

salary of public servants. However, profit and

dividend transfers from major SOBEs declined

by 22.5 per cent to Rs. 41.8 billion during 2018

from Rs. 54.0 billion in the previous year. Overall,

the share of non tax revenue in total revenue

increased during the year to 10.8 per cent from

8.8 per cent in 2017.

Grants

Total foreign grants received from

multilateral and bilateral sources during the

year increased to Rs. 12.5 billion from Rs. 8.0

billion in 2017. However, grants from multilateral

sources declined significantly by 30.3 per cent to

Rs. 3.8 billion in 2018 compared to Rs. 5.5 billion

recorded in 2017. Accordingly, the share of grants

from multilateral sources declined significantly to

30.6 per cent from 68.2 per cent recorded in 2017.

Meanwhile, grants from bilateral sources increased

significantly to Rs. 8.7 billion in 2018 from Rs. 2.6

billion in 2017. The major development partners

who provided grants during the year were the

Government of Japan, the Government of India

and the World Bank.

Expenditure and Net Lending

The total expenditure and net lending

as a per cent of GDP declined to 18.6 per

cent in 2018 from 19.2 per cent in 2017

mainly due to the moderation of public

investment. Accordingly, as a per cent of GDP,

recurrent expenditure increased marginally to

14.5 per cent in 2018 from 14.4 per cent in 2017

while capital expenditure and net lending declined

significantly to 4.2 per cent in 2018 compared to

4.8 per cent recorded in the previous year. Public

investment, which includes capital expenditure

and on lending of the government, declined to

4.3 per cent of GDP in 2018 from 4.9 per cent

of GDP in 2017. However, in nominal terms,

total expenditure and net lending increased by

4.7 per cent to Rs. 2,693.2 billion in 2018 from

Rs. 2,573.1 billion in 2017, while capital

expenditure and net lending declined, even in

nominal terms, to Rs. 603.5 billion in 2018 from

Rs. 645.4 billion in 2017.

The recurrent expenditure as a per cent of

GDP increased marginally to 14.5 per cent in

2018 from 14.4 per cent in 2017. However, in

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

207

nominal terms, recurrent expenditure increased

by 8.4 per cent to Rs. 2,089.7 billion in 2018

from Rs. 1,927.7 billion in 2017. The increase

in interest payments mainly contributed to the

increase in recurrent expenditure in nominal

terms. As a percentage of GDP, an increase in

interest payments contributed to the marginal

increase in recurrent expenditure amidst the

lower expenditure on salaries and wages and

current transfers and subsidies.

The interest payments as a percentage of

GDP increased to 5.9 per cent in 2018 from

5.5 per cent in 2017. In nominal terms, interest

expenditure increased by 15.9 per cent to Rs. 852.2

billion in 2018 from Rs. 735.6 billion in 2017 due

to the increase in interest rates and borrowings.

The interest payments on domestic debt, which

increased by 12.1 per cent to Rs. 639.5 billion in

2018 from Rs. 570.6 billion in 2017 accounted for

75.0 per cent of total interest payments in 2018. The

interest expenditure on Treasury bonds amounted

to Rs. 501.5 billion in 2018, an increase of

14.4 per cent mainly due to the increased net

issuances of Treasury bonds in 2018. Interest

payments on Treasury bills declined by 8.3 per cent

to Rs. 74.5 billion in 2018 from Rs. 81.3 billion in

2017 due to the lower interest rates that prevailed

in the first half of 2018 although the interest rates

rose during the latter part of the year. In addition,

interest payments on Sri Lanka Development

Bonds (SLDBs) and Rupee loans amounted to

Rs. 41.0 billion and Rs. 2.9 billion, respectively,

in 2018. Interest expenditure on foreign debt

increased by 29.0 per cent to Rs. 212.7 billion

in 2018 from Rs. 164.9 billion in 2017 due to the

elevated interest rates in the international markets

and the significant rise in the foreign borrowings

in the recent past. Interest payments continued

to be the single largest recurrent expenditure item, accounting for 40.8 per cent of total recurrent expenditure and 44.4 per cent of government revenue in 2018.

The expenditure on goods and services remained unchanged at 5.6 per cent of GDP in 2018 as in the previous year. However, in nominal terms expenditure on goods and services increased by 6.5 per cent to Rs. 806.0 billion from Rs. 756.6 billion in 2017. Salaries and wages, the

largest expenditure item in this category, declined

to 4.3 per cent of GDP in 2018 from 4.4 per cent

of GDP in the previous year. However, in nominal

terms outlays on salaries and wages increased

by 6.4 per cent to Rs. 626.0 billion in 2018 from

Rs. 588.5 billion in 2017. Salaries and wages paid

to central government employees, including defence

personnel, increased by 5.7 per cent to Rs. 464.0

billion, while the central government contribution to

salaries and wages of employees of PCs increased

by 8.3 per cent to Rs. 162.1 billion during the year.

This was mainly due to the continuation of the

inclusion of interim allowance to the basic salary

with the implementation of the new salary structure

from January 2016 onwards for public sector

employees. Salaries and wages continued to be the

second largest recurrent expenditure item with its

share in recurrent expenditure marginally reducing

to 30.0 per cent in 2018 from 30.5 per cent in 2017.

Expenditure on other goods and services increased

by 7.1 per cent to Rs. 180.0 billion in nominal terms,

although declining to 1.2 per cent in 2018 from

1.3 per cent in 2017 as a per cent of GDP.

Total current transfers and subsidies

declined during the year both in nominal terms

and as a percentage of GDP. Accordingly, total

current transfers and subsidies, as a percentage

of GDP declined to 3.0 per cent in 2018 from

3.2 per cent in 2017 due to the decline in current

transfers to the household sector. Similarly, in

nominal terms, current transfers and subsidies

declined by 0.9 per cent to Rs. 431.5 billion in

2018 from Rs. 435.5 billion in 2017 due to the

reduction in current transfers to households and

public corporations. Current transfers to households

and other sectors accounted for 79.4 per cent of

total current transfers, while transfers to public

institutions and public corporations accounted for

14.3 per cent and 6.3 per cent, respectively, in

2018.

Current transfers to households which

include pension payments, declined to

2.4 per cent of GDP in 2018 from 2.6 per cent of

However, in nominal terms, current transfers

to public institutions increased while current

transfers to public corporations declined during

the year. Accordingly, current transfers to public

institutions increased by 13.3 per cent to Rs. 61.6

billion during the year, mainly due to the increase

in current transfers to the education sector,

particularly for government universities. However,

current transfers to public corporations declined by

11.1 per cent to Rs. 27.3 billion due to the reduction

in current transfers to the transport sector which

reflected the measures taken by the government

to improve efficiency of public corporations.

Transfers provided to cover operational losses

of the Department of Sri Lanka Railways and the

Department of Posts declined during the year to

Rs. 7.0 billion and Rs. 5.2 billion, respectively.

Capital expenditure and net lending declined

both in nominal terms and as a percentage of

GDP due to the slowdown in the implementation

of capital projects. Accordingly, as a percentage

of GDP, capital expenditure and net lending

declined significantly to 4.2 per cent in 2018 from

4.8 per cent in 2017. Similarly, in nominal terms,

capital expenditure and net lending declined by

6.5 per cent to Rs. 603.5 billion during the year

from to Rs. 645.4 billion in the previous year.

Meanwhile, public investment, which includes

capital expenditure and on lending of the

government, declined in GDP terms to 4.3 per

cent in 2018 from 4.9 per cent in the previous year.

In nominal terms, public investment declined by

4.9 per cent to Rs. 625.0 billion in 2018 from

Rs. 657.4 billion in 2017. Expenditure incurred by

Ministries and Departments on the acquisition of

real assets, including the purchase of capital assets

and construction and development of fixed assets,

also declined by 1.2 per cent to Rs. 355.8 billion

in 2018. Moreover, capital transfers declined by

7.7 per cent to Rs. 256.8 billion due to the reduction

GDP in 2017. Similarly, in nominal terms, current

transfers to households declined by 2.2 per cent

to Rs. 342.5 billion in 2018 from Rs. 350.4 billion

in 2017. Pension payments, the largest item under

transfers to households, increased by 7.4 per cent

to Rs. 194.5 billion in 2018 due to the increase

in the number of pensioners during the year by

22,986 to 622,508 and the increase in the monthly

pension as a result of the hike in basic salaries

of government employees. Expenditure on the

Samurdhi programme amounted to Rs. 39.2 billion

in 2018 which is a marginal decline of 1.2 per cent

in comparison to the previous year. Expenditure on

welfare programmes for disabled soldiers increased

by 9.2 per cent over the previous year to Rs. 30.4

billion in 2018. Meanwhile, expenses incurred on

the fertiliser subsidy declined by 11.2 per cent to

Rs. 26.9 billion in 2018 from the previous year due

to the reduction in paddy cultivation which resulted

from the drought condition. Further, the recurrent

expenditure incurred on disaster relief measures

was around 0.1 per cent of GDP in 2018.

Current transfers to public institutions and

public corporations as a percentage of GDP

remained unchanged as in the previous year.

Accordingly, current transfers to public institutions

and public corporations remained at 0.4 per cent

of GDP and 0.2 per cent of GDP, respectively.

in transfers to public institutions by 7.1 per cent.

Meanwhile, on lending of the government to public

corporations amounted to Rs. 12.4 billion in 2018,

a decline of 34.8 per cent from Rs. 19.0 billion

recorded in 2017.

Amidst the limited fiscal space available,

investments in economic and social services

declined significantly during the year.

Accordingly, public investments in economic

services decreased to Rs. 437.9 billion in 2018

from Rs. 474.1 billion in 2017. Similarly, public

investments in social services amounted to

Rs. 133.2 billion in 2018 in comparison to Rs. 135.4

billion in 2017. Public investments in economic

services were mainly channelled towards improving

the transportation network of the country while

facilitating agricultural activities through upgrading

of irrigation systems. Public investment in social

services focused largely on improving the quality of

education and health sectors. Accordingly, during

the year, measures were taken to upgrade the

infrastructure in the education sector with the aim

of providing equal education opportunities to every

child in the country. Meanwhile, public investments

in the health sector focused mainly on constructing

and upgrading hospitals and improving laboratory

facilities to enhance the quality of service delivery

in the health sector.

Key Fiscal Balances

The budget deficit and primary surplus

improved during the year, while the current

account deficit increased marginally. The

overall budget deficit as a percentage of

GDP improved to 5.3 per cent in 2018 from

5.5 per cent in the previous year, supported

by the moderation in total expenditure despite

a decline in revenue as a percentage of GDP.

However, the budget deficit deviated from the

target of 4.8 per cent envisaged in the Budget

2018. Meanwhile, the primary surplus increased to

0.6 per cent (Rs. 91.4 billion) in 2018 from

0.02 per cent (Rs. 2.1 billion) in 2017, reflecting

mainly the reduction in capital expenditure

during the year. However, the current account

deficit increased to 1.2 per cent in 2018 from

0.7 per cent in 2017, reflecting slippages in the

revenue collection and an overrun in recurrent

expenditure, largely due to higher than estimated

interest payments.

Financing of the Budget Deficit

The overall budget deficit was financed

largely through domestic sources in 2018.

Financing through domestic sources accounted

for 3.0 per cent of GDP in 2018 when compared

to 2.2 per cent of GDP in 2017. In terms of

the overall budget deficit, 57.5 per cent of the

resource requirement (Rs. 437.2 billion) was

financed through domestic sources in 2018 in

comparison to 40.1 per cent (Rs. 294.3 billion)

in 2017. Consequently, the share of financing

through foreign sources declined notably to

42.5 per cent (Rs. 323.5 billion) in 2018 from

59.9 per cent (Rs. 439.2 billion) in 2017.

Accordingly, financing through foreign sources as

a percentage of GDP declined to 2.2 per cent in

2018 from 3.3 per cent in 2017.

In the domestic sources of financing the

budget deficit, dependence on the domestic

banking sector reduced significantly, while

the reliance on domestic non bank sources

increased substantially in 2018. Accordingly,

financing from the banking sector reduced

considerably to Rs. 109.5 billion (25.0 per cent of

domestic financing) in 2018 from Rs. 187.6 billion

(63.8 per cent) in 2017. Financing from the Central

Bank increased notably to Rs. 246.1 billion in

2018 from a net repayment of Rs. 187.9 billion in

2017. Purchase of Treasury bills by the Central

Bank entirely contributed to the net increase in

borrowings from the Central Bank during 2018.

However, financing from commercial banks

recorded a net repayment of Rs. 136.6 billion

during the year compared to net borrowings of

Rs. 375.7 billion in 2017. Repayments to

commercial banks were largely on account

of SLDBs and Treasury bonds owing to the

retirement of Treasury bonds and SLDBs during

the year, while borrowings through Treasury bills

declined significantly. However, financing from

non bank sources accounted for 75.0 per cent

(Rs. 327.8 billion) of total net domestic financing

in 2018 in comparison to 36.2 per cent (Rs. 106.5

billion) in 2017. The financing from non bank

sources included Rs. 107.9 billion of proceeds

from the long lease of Hambantota Port in 2018.

Funds mobilised through foreign sources

declined in 2018 with significant outflows in

foreign holdings of rupee denominated Treasury

bonds and Treasury bills. Accordingly, financing of

the budget deficit through foreign borrowings reduced

to Rs. 323.5 billion in 2018 from Rs. 439.2 billion in

2017. Net borrowings through ISBs amounted to

Rs. 390.4 billion (US dollars 2.5 billion) in 2018, in

comparison to Rs. 228.5 billion (US dollars 1.5

billion) in 2017. A net outflow of Rs. 141.1 billion was

recorded in respect of foreign holdings of government

securities compared to a net inflow of Rs. 57.3 billion

in the previous year. Meanwhile, net borrowings

through the FCTFF amounted to Rs. 66.6 billion

in 2018 as compared to Rs. 152.7 billion in 2017.

Net borrowings through foreign project loans

increased to Rs. 7.7 billion in comparison to

Rs. 779 million in 2017. The Export-Import Bank of

China (Exim Bank), IDA, the Government of Japan

and Asian Development Bank (ADB) were the main

sources of foreign project financing in 2018.

increased significantly in 2018. Accordingly,

domestic instrument based borrowings increased to

Rs. 298.0 billion in 2018 from Rs. 80.8 billion in 2017

mainly due to higher borrowings through government

securities. Borrowings through Treasury bonds

increased significantly to Rs. 374.5 billion in 2018

from Rs. 109.1 billion in 2017. Meanwhile, borrowings

through Treasury bills amounted to Rs. 52.9 billion

in 2018 as against the net repayment of Rs. 81.7

billion in 2017. Borrowings through SLDBs recorded

a net repayment of Rs. 129.5 billion compared to net

borrowings of Rs. 53.3 billion in 2017. Meanwhile, non

instrument borrowings declined to Rs. 139.3 billion in

2018 compared to Rs. 213.5 billion in 2017 due to the

decline in Central Bank provisional advances during

the year.

Foreign currency denominated domestic

borrowings, which include SLDBs and short

term loans from foreign currency banking units

(FCBUs) recorded an overall net repayment

during 2018. Accordingly, borrowings through

SLDBs amounted to a net repayment of Rs. 129.5

billion, while borrowings through FCBUs declined,

on a net basis, to Rs. 19.1 billion in 2018. The

net repayment of SLDBs during the year was the

difference between gross borrowings of SLDBs

amounting to Rs. 234.1 billion (US dollars 1.5

billion) and the repayments of SLDBs amounting

to Rs. 363.6 billion (US dollars 2.3 billion). On a net

basis, foreign currency borrowings from domestic

sources recorded a net repayment of Rs. 110.4

billion in 2018 compared to a net borrowing of

Rs. 86.6 billion in 2017, while rupee denominated

net domestic financing amounted to Rs. 547.6

billion compared to Rs. 207.7 billion in 2017.

6.4 Government Debt and Debt Service Payments

Central Government Debt

The central government debt to GDP ratio

increased to 82.9 per cent at end 2018 from

76.9 per cent at end 2017. The increase in the

debt to GDP ratio in 2018 was the combined effect

of the depreciation of the rupee against major

foreign currencies, relatively low nominal GDP and

higher net borrowings to finance the budget deficit.

In absolute terms, the total outstanding central

government debt stock increased by 16.1 per cent

to Rs. 11,977.5 billion at end 2018. This increase

includes the impact of exchange rate variations

amounting to Rs. 1,063.2 billion due to the sharp

depreciation of the rupee against foreign currencies

in 2018. Meanwhile, the debt stock increased by

Rs. 81.2 billion due to the discount factor, which is

the net amount of the difference between the book

value and the face value of issuances of Treasury

bills and Treasury bonds during the year. The

share of domestic debt as a percentage of GDP

decreased marginally to 41.6 per cent by end 2018

from 41.7 per cent at end 2017, while the share of

foreign debt increased notably to 41.2 per cent of

GDP at the end of 2018 from 35.2 per cent of GDP

at end 2017.

The share of domestic debt in the total

outstanding debt declined for the third

consecutive year to 50.2 per cent at end

2018 from 54.2 per cent at end 2017. In

nominal terms, the domestic debt increased by

7.6 per cent in 2018 to Rs. 6,018.0 billion at

to Rs. 4,140.7 billion at end 2018, dominated the

outstanding domestic debt portfolio, accounting

for 68.8 per cent of the total domestic debt at end

2018, in comparison to 68.3 per cent or Rs. 3,822.6

billion at end 2017. However, the stock of SLDBs

declined by 3.7 per cent to Rs. 614.2 billion at end

2018, reflecting the lower reliance on SLDBs to

finance the budget deficit during the year.

The debt obligation of the central

government to the domestic banking sector

declined marginally to Rs. 2,315.3 billion at

end 2018 due to the decline in outstanding

debt owned by commercial banks, despite

the increase in the outstanding debt owned

by the Central Bank to Rs. 244.1 billion. The

share of the banking sector debt in total domestic

debt declined to 38.5 per cent by end 2018 from

41.6 per cent at end 2017. The significant

increase in the debt held by the Central Bank

was due to Treasury bills amounting to Rs. 45.8

billion during the year in comparison to Rs. 9.9

billion in 2017. However, the outstanding balance

of provisional advances declined marginally at

end 2018 to Rs. 198.6 billion. Meanwhile, the

outstanding debt owned by commercial banks

declined to Rs. 2,071.2 billion at end 2018 mainly

due to lower investments in Treasury bonds by

end 2018 in comparison to an increase of

4.7 per cent in 2017. The share of short term debt

in total domestic debt increased to 18.9 per cent

at end 2018 from 18.4 per cent at end 2017. The

increase in short term debt is largely reflected

in the increase in the overdraft balances of the

government and the outstanding stock of Treasury

bills. Treasury bills in short term domestic debt also

increased to Rs. 746.9 billion by end 2018 from

Rs. 697.2 billion at end 2017. However, the

outstanding debt on account of provisional

advances declined marginally to Rs. 198.6 billion

at end 2018 from Rs. 199.8 billion at end 2017.

Meanwhile, the share of medium to long term debt

in the domestic debt stock declined marginally to

81.1 per cent in 2018 from 81.6 per cent in 2017.

commercial banks in 2018. Accordingly, the stock

of Treasury bonds held by commercial banks

declined to Rs. 658.1 billion at end 2018 from

Rs. 803.5 billion at end 2017. The share of non

bank sector debt in total domestic debt increased to

61.5 per cent in 2018 from 58.4 per cent in

the previous year, recording an outstanding of

Rs. 3,702.6 billion due to higher investments in

Treasury bonds by the non bank sector at end

2018.

The foreign currency denominated domestic

debt increased marginally to Rs. 714.7 billion

(US dollars 3,911.0 million) at end 2018 from

Rs. 702.1 billion (US dollars 4,593.2 million) at

end 2017. The outstanding balance on account of

FCBUs rose notably to Rs. 100.5 billion (US dollars

550 million) at end 2018, while loans obtained from

SLDBs declined to Rs. 614.2 billion (US dollars

3,361 million). Meanwhile, rupee denominated

domestic debt increased by Rs. 410.9 billion to

Rs. 5,303.3 billion at end 2018.

The total stock of foreign debt of the central

government in rupee terms continued to

increase in 2018 with the depreciation of the

rupee against major foreign currencies. The

outstanding balance of foreign debt increased

significantly to Rs. 5,959.5 billion at end 2018

from Rs. 4,718.6 billion at end 2017. Non

concessional loans, including commercial loans,

increased to Rs. 3,253.7 billion in 2018 mainly

due to the issuance of ISBs (US dollars 2.5 billion)

and issuance of FCTFF (US dollars 1.0 billion).

Within this category, the outstanding foreign

holdings of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds

declined significantly by Rs. 163.8 billion to Rs.

158.8 billion mainly reflecting significant outflows

of foreign investments from the government

securities market with the policy rate hikes of the

Federal Reserve of the USA. Meanwhile, with

the issuance of ISBs in 2018, the outstanding

stock of ISBs increased notably to Rs. 2,220.4

billion (US dollars 12.2 billion) at end 2018.

However, the share of non concessional loans in

the foreign debt portfolio declined marginally to

54.6 per cent at end 2018 from 54.8 per cent at

end 2017. The outstanding stock of concessional

debt increased to Rs. 2,705.8 billion at end 2018

from Rs. 2,130.5 billion at end 2017.

The depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee

against several major currencies resulted in

an increase in the total debt stock, in rupee

terms, by Rs. 1,063.2 billion at end 2018. The

Sri Lankan rupee depreciated notably by 16.4 per

cent, 18.1 per cent, 14.1 per cent, 12.7 per cent,

11.4 per cent and 8.7 per cent, against the US

dollar, the Japanese yen, Special Drawing Rights

(SDR), the euro, the pound sterling and the

Indian rupee, respectively, during the year. The

government foreign debt stock consisted of debt

denominated in US dollars (63.5 per cent), SDR

(16.0 per cent), Japanese yen (10.5 per cent), euro

(3.8 per cent) and other currencies (6.3 per cent)

as at end 2018. Consequently, the outstanding

stock of foreign debt increased by Rs. 963.2 billion

mainly due to the depreciation of the Sri Lankan

rupee against major foreign currencies, while

the foreign currency denominated domestic debt

stock (SLDBs and loans from FCBUs) increased

by Rs. 100.0 billion due to the depreciation of the

Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar. Although

the impact of depreciation of the Sri Lankan

rupee would be reflected as an increase in the

government foreign currency debt stock in rupee

terms, the outstanding debt stock denominated

in foreign currency would remain unchanged

in terms of foreign currency, irrespective of

such depreciation. As the debt denominated in

foreign currency would be serviced using foreign

currency inflows to the government, the impact

of such a nominal increase in the outstanding

balance due to the depreciation of the rupee

would be less material in the context of foreign

currency debt servicing.

Central Government Debt Service Payments

Total debt service payments in 2018

amounted to Rs. 2,088.6 billion in nominal terms,

recording a substantial increase of 30.3 per cent

(Rs. 485.5 billion) in comparison to Rs. 1,603.0

billion in 2017. An increase in both amortisation

payments and interest payments contributed to the

increase in total debt service payments during the

year. Amortisation payments, which accounted for

59.2 per cent of total debt service payments

increased considerably by 42.5 per cent to

Rs. 1,236.4 billion in 2018 from Rs. 867.5 billion

in 2017. The increase in the maturing of Treasury

bonds and SLDBs, and repayment of loans obtained

through FCBUs and FCTFF mainly contributed

to the increase in amortisation payments during

the year. The amortisation payments on Treasury

bonds and SLDBs increased by 43.3 per cent and

27.5 per cent, respectively to Rs. 510.0 billion and

Rs. 363.6 billion in 2018. Similarly amortisation

payments to FCBUs also increased notably by

Rs. 46.0 billion to Rs. 47.8 billion during 2018 due

to the repayment of loans obtained from FCBUs.

Meanwhile, repayment of foreign loans rose by

40.1 per cent to Rs. 314.5 billion mainly due to

the repayment of the part of the FCTFF. The total

interest payments also increased by 15.9 per cent to

Rs. 852.2 billion in 2018 from Rs. 735.6 billion in

2017. High domestic interest payments were mainly

due to a 14.4 per cent increase in interest payments

on Treasury bonds amounting to Rs. 501.5 billion

in 2018 reflecting increased issuances. Interest

payments on foreign loans rose by 29.0 per cent

(Rs. 47.8 billion) to Rs. 212.7 billion in 2018 in

comparison to 2017 mainly due to higher interest

payments on foreign commercial borrowings and

the depreciation of the rupee against major foreign

currencies. Debt service payments to domestic

sources increased by 28.7 per cent to Rs. 1,561.4

billion, while debt service payments to foreign sources

rose by 35.3 per cent to Rs. 527.2 billion during 2018.

Debt service payments related indicators

weakened in 2018. Total debt service payments

increased to 14.5 per cent of GDP in 2018 from 11.9

per cent of GDP in the previous year. Amortisation

payments on domestic debt as a percentage of GDP

increased to 6.4 per cent in 2018 from 4.8 per cent in

2017, while amortisation payments on foreign debt

also increased to 2.2 per cent of GDP in 2018 from

1.7 per cent of GDP in 2017. Total interest payments

as a percentage of GDP increased to 5.9 per cent in

2018 from 5.5 per cent in 2017. Interest payments

on domestic debt increased to 4.4 per cent of GDP

in 2018 from 4.3 per cent of GDP in 2017 while

interest payments on foreign debt increased to

1.5 per cent of GDP in 2018 from 1.2 per cent of

GDP in the previous year. Moreover, the ratio of

debt service payments to government revenue

increased substantially to 108.8 per cent in 2018

from 87.5 per cent in 2017, indicating that the total

debt service payment of the government is larger

than the government revenue in 2018. The ratio of

foreign debt service payments to exports increased

to 16.0 per cent in 2018 from 13.4 per cent in 2017.

Outstanding Public Debt

The outstanding public debt, which includes

central government debt, outstanding Treasury

bonds issued for restructuring of SOEs,

foreign project loans received by SOEs, public

guaranteed debt and outstanding international

bonds issued by SOEs increased notably in

2018. The total outstanding public debt (excluding

state owned banking institutions) increased

to 91.2 per cent of GDP by end 2018 from

84.2 per cent of GDP in the previous year, mainly

due to the depreciation of the rupee against major

foreign currencies, relatively low nominal GDP

and higher net borrowings in the public sector.

In absolute terms, the total outstanding public

debt increased to Rs. 13,182.1 billion at end

2018 from Rs. 11,303.5 billion at end 2017. The

outstanding central government debt, which is the

largest subset of the total public debt, increased by

6.5 Budgetary Operations in Sub National Governments

Policy Direction and Measures taken by Sub National Governments

As in the previous years, the Ministry of

Internal and Home Affairs and Provincial

Councils and Local Government continued to

play a vital role in the development process

of the sub national governments in 2018. The

sub national government system in Sri Lanka

comprises nine Provincial Councils (PCs) and

341 Local Government authorities (LGs). At end

2018, the LG system comprised 22 Municipal

Councils, 43 Urban Councils and 276 Pradesheeya

16.1 per cent to Rs. 11,977.5 billion at end 2018,

accounting for 90.9 per cent of the total public debt.

Public guaranteed debt increased by 33.0 per cent

to Rs. 749.8 billion at end 2018 from Rs. 563.7

billion at end 2017, accounting for 5.7 per cent of

the total outstanding public debt. Meanwhile, foreign

project loans received by SOEs and outstanding

international bonds issued by SOEs increased to

Rs. 366.1 billion and Rs. 32.0 billion, respectively

at end 2018 from Rs. 330.2 billion and 26.8 billion,

respectively reported at end 2017. However,

outstanding Treasury bonds issued for restructuring

of SOEs declined to Rs. 56.7 billion at end 2018 from

Rs. 69.8 billion at end 2017 due to the retirement of

Treasury bonds in August 2018, which were issued

to raise capital of SriLankan Airlines.

Sabhas. Accordingly, the Ministry maintained a better

coordination with sub national government authorities

during the year, in order to identify the development

needs at the sub national level and facilitate

investments through effective donor coordination

thereby enhancing balanced regional development.

At the sub national government level, priority

was given to develop infrastructure facilities

including the upgrading of education and

health sectors. Accordingly, the Local Government

Enhancement Sector Project (Pura Neguma

programme) continued in 2018 with the objective

of improving access to safe and affordable drinking

water.The Transforming School Education as the

Foundation of a Knowledge Hub project continued

during the year in order to improve the facilities of

selected schools while ensuring equal access to

education. The Health Sector Development Project

also continued during the year with the aim of

improving maternal and child health care facilities.

Further, in order to protect the environment while

creating a healthy atmosphere, the National Solid

Waste Management Project continued while actions

were taken to promote household composting and

waste segregation with the help of constructing

compost yards and waste collecting centers. In

addition, the Greater Colombo Water and Waste

Water Management Programme and Construction of

Rural Bridges Project also continued during the year.

The Finance Commission recommended

several measures during the year with a view

to achieving balanced regional development.

Accordingly, the Commission recommended to

establish a common framework which includes

required national and sub national level information

for planning and monitoring in order to improve the

effectiveness of the decision making process. Further,

the Commission recommended that funds disbursed

for development activities coming under devolved

subjects should be channelled through the PCs,

in order to ensure the effective utilisation of funds

and maintain transparency and accountability of

investments. Further, the Commision recommended

to ensure a strong coordination between national

and sub national authorities in order to utilise scarce

resources effectively. In addition, advice was given to

strictly adhere to the Commission’s recommendations

in distributing capital funds among PCs in order to

achieve balanced regional growth.

Budgetary Operations in Provincial Councils

The total revenue of PCs continued to

increase in nominal terms in 2018, although as

a percentage of GDP it remained unchanged

as in the previous year. Total revenue of PCs

increased by 4.6 per cent to Rs. 90.9 billion in 2018

from Rs. 87.0 billion in 2017 due to the increase in

tax revenue while a decline was recorded in non tax

revenue. However, as a percentage of GDP, total

revenue remained unchanged at 0.6 per cent as in

the previous year. In nominal terms, tax revenue

increased by 6.0 per cent to Rs. 82.4 billion while

non tax revenue declined by 7.7 per cent to Rs. 8.6

billion in 2018. The transfers of NBT revenue from

the central government increased by 3.5 per cent to

Rs. 33.9 billion due to the higher NBT revenue

collection following the removal of the exemption

applicable on the importation and manufacture

of liquor in July 2018. Revenue from stamp duty

increased by 11.5 per cent to Rs. 35.1 billion in 2018

due to the imposition of stamp duty on liquor licenses

and license for the sale of bottled toddy in October

2018. Revenue from license fees increased to Rs.

11.7 billion in 2018 from Rs. 11.0 billion in 2017.

Revenue from stamp duty and the transfers of NBT

revenue from the central government accounted for

42.6 per cent and 41.2 per cent of total tax revenue

of PCs, respectively. The share of revenue of the

Western Provincial Council of the total revenue

collection by all PCs increased to 51.8 per cent in 2018

from 51.2 per cent in 2017. Of the revenue collection

by the other PCs, the North Western and Southern

provinces accounted for 9.4 per cent and 9.3 per cent

of the total revenue, respectively. Meanwhile, the

share of revenue collected from the Sabaragamuwa

province declined to 4.3 per cent in 2018 from

4.9 per cent in 2017.

Recurrent expenditure of PCs in 2018 increased

in nominal terms while declining marginally as a

percentage of GDP during the year. Accordingly,

in nominal terms, recurrent expenditure increased by

4.5 per cent to Rs. 252.2 billion in 2018 while as a

percentage of GDP, recurrent expenditure declined

to 1.7 per cent in 2018 from 1.8 per cent in the

previous year. The increase in recurrent expenditure

was mainly due to higher expenditure on personal

emoluments. Accordingly, personal emoluments

during 2018 amounted to Rs. 197.4 billion recording

an increase of 5.4 per cent and continued to be

the single largest item in the recurrent expenditure

accounting for 78.3 per cent of the total recurrent

expenditure of PCs. The education and health

sectors absorbed around 90 per cent of the personal

emoluments of PCs. On a functional basis, recurrent

expenditure on social services and economic

services increased to Rs. 227.4 and Rs. 4.5 billion,

respectively while outlays on provincial administration

declined to Rs. 20.3 billion in 2018. The three highest

spending PCs, in 2018 were the Western, the Central

and the North Western accounting for 21.3 per cent,

12.6 per cent and 11.9 per cent of total recurrent

expenditure, respectively.

Capital expenditure of PCs as a percentage

of GDP remained unchanged over the previous

year, although a decline was reported in nominal

terms. Accordingly, capital expenditure in nominal

terms declined by 9.0 per cent to Rs. 42.3 billion

in 2018. This was mainly due to the decline on

expenditure in Province Specific Development

Projects (PSDPs) by 33.2 per cent to Rs. 13.5

billion, capital expenditure on special projects by

32.1 per cent to Rs. 7.5 billion and capital transfers

to local governments by 5.1 per cent to Rs. 3.6 billion

amidst the increase in acquisition of capital goods by

38.7 per cent to Rs. 14.2 billion, in 2018. However, as

a percentage of GDP, capital expenditure remained

unchanged at 0.3 per cent as in the previous year.

In 2018, transfers from the central government

to PCs mainly through block grants increased by

1.4 per cent to Rs. 203.6 billion while grants for

special projects, Province Specific Development

Grants (PSDGs) and Criteria Based Grants

(CBGs) declined during the year. Block grants,

the major form of central government transfers to

PCs, amounted to Rs. 180.1 billion, representing

88.5 per cent of the total transfers that were provided

to meet the resource gap in the recurrent expenditure

programme of PCs. The transfers under grants for

special projects, PSDGs and CBGs amounted to

Rs. 7.5 billion, Rs. 13.5 billion and Rs. 2.5 billion,

respectively. During the year, a share of 69.1 per cent

of the expenditure of PCs was financed through central

government transfers which underscores the urgent

need to strengthen PCs by way of enhancing their

revenue generation and rationalising expenditure, in

line with the fiscal consolidation efforts of the central

government.
