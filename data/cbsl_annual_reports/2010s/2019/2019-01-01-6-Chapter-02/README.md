2.1 OverviewT

he Sri Lankan economy grew at a

moderate pace of 3.2 per cent in 2018,

in real terms, compared to 3.4 per

cent in 2017, in the midst of headwinds from a

challenging domestic and external environment.

Favourable weather conditions that prevailed

in the major cultivation areas enabled a strong

recovery in Agricultural activities throughout

the year, resulting in a bumper paddy harvest

during the year. Meanwhile, Services activities,

which provided the highest contribution to

the economy in 2018, were led by growth in

financial services, and wholesale and retail

trade activities and were also supported by the

spillover effects of the rebound in agricultural

activities. However, Industry activities slowed

down, dampening economic growth, owing to the

setback in construction and mining activities and

the moderate growth in manufacturing activities.

Business surveys, conducted by the Central

Bank, signalled that delayed implementation of

structural reforms and policy uncertainty that

prevailed throughout the year together with the

heightened political tension during the latter

part of the year have had an adverse impact on

much-needed business confidence and investor

sentiment. Meanwhile, public investment also

declined due to fiscal consolidation measures

targeted at rationalising government expenditure.

Despite the sharp depreciation of the Sri Lankan

rupee against major currencies, net external

demand remained weaker. Moreover, domestic

savings slowed in 2018, with a moderation in

private savings and the continued increase in

government dis-savings. Further, net primary

income from the rest of the world continued to

record negative growth during the year. However,

net current transfers from the rest of the world

increased with the improvement in workers’

remittances in rupee terms. As a combined

outcome of these developments, national

savings grew at a slower pace in comparison to

investments. Accordingly, the resource gap of

the economy broadened during the year.

2.2 GDP, GDP Per Capita and Gross National Income (GNI)

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at both

current market prices and constant market

prices (hereinafter referred to as current price

and constant price, respectively) recorded a

moderate growth during 2018 compared to 2017.

GDP at current prices was estimated at Rs. 14,449.9

billion (US dollars 88.9 billion) in 2018, while it was

Rs. 13,418.3 billion (US dollars 88.0 billion) in 2017.

Accordingly, GDP at current prices recorded a growth

of 7.7 per cent in 2018, compared to the higher growth

of 11.9 per cent recorded in 2017. This indicates a

relatively low price pressure which was also reflected

in the percentage change in the implicit GDP deflator,

which decreased to 4.3 per cent in 2018, from 8.2

per cent in 2017, and the moderate growth of GDP at

constant prices which was estimated at Rs. 9,644.7

billion in 2018, compared to Rs. 9,344.8 billion in

2017. Accordingly, real GDP growth continued its

moderating trend and grew by 3.2 per cent in 2018,

compared to 3.4 per cent growth recorded in 2017.

GDP per capita was estimated at Rs. 666,817

in 2018 in comparison to Rs. 625,736 in 2017,

recording an increase of 6.6 per cent in 2018

compared to that of 10.6 per cent in 2017. The slow

growth in GDP per capita in rupee terms was mainly

associated with the slowdown in GDP at current

prices since the mid-year population growth rate was

stable. Moreover, per capita GDP in US dollar terms

stood at US dollars 4,102 in 2018, almost similar to

2017 level of US dollars 4,104, which recorded a 5.6

per cent growth in 2017. This performance was mainly

due to the weakening of the domestic currency,

particularly during the latter part of the year alongside

the moderate growth of GDP at current prices.

GNI, which is estimated by adjusting GDP

for the net primary income from the rest of the

world, increased to Rs. 14,058 billion at current

prices, recording a growth rate of 7.6 per cent

in 2018, compared to 11.9 per cent growth in

2017. This slowdown in the growth of GNI was a

combined outcome of moderate growth in the GDP

at current prices and 11.1 per cent decline observed

in net primary income from rest of the world in 2018,

compared to the contraction of 10.4 per cent in 2017.

2.3 Contribution from

Institutional Sectors

As per the gross value added estimates at

current prices under the production approach,

the Households and Non-Profit Institutions

Serving Households (HH and NPISH) sector

continued to be the largest contributor to the

economy. The HH and NPISH sector grew by 8.2

per cent at current prices in 2018, compared to the

growth of 10.2 per cent in 2017, accounting for a 49.8

per cent of the total gross value added of the economy

in 2018. Meanwhile, the Non-Financial Corporations

(NFC) sector, being the second largest sector of the

economy, accounted for 34.7 per cent share of the

total gross value added and grew by 7.8 per cent

in 2018, compared to the growth of 10.5 per cent

recorded in 2017. Further, the General Government

(GG) sector, which accounted for 10.3 per cent of the

total gross value added of the economy, grew by 17.9

per cent in 2018, in comparison to 6.2 per cent growth

recorded in 2017 while the Financial Corporations

(FC) sector, which accounted for 5.2 per cent of the

total gross value added, grew by 3.9 per cent in 2018,

compared to the growth of 28.1 per cent recorded in

2017.

The primary contributor to the gross value

added of Agriculture and Services activities

during 2018 was the HH and NPISH sector,

while the NFC sector primarily contributed for

the gross value added of Industry activities at

current prices. Accordingly, 81.7 per cent of the

gross value added of Agriculture activities was

generated from the HH and NPISH sector in 2018,

recording a growth of 10.5 per cent, compared to

16.2 per cent growth recorded in the previous year.

In the meantime, 52.1 per cent of the gross value

added of Services activities was generated by the

HH and NPISH sector in 2018, recording a growth

of 8.6 per cent compared to 8.7 per cent growth

recorded in 2017. Meanwhile, the NFC sector

accounted for 62.6 per cent of the gross value

added of the Industry activities, recording a growth

rate of 6.7 per cent during 2018, in comparison to

the growth of 10.0 per cent observed in 2017.

2.4 Output, Policies, Institutional Support and Issues

Agriculture

Recovering from the negative performance

observed during the past two years, the value

added of Agriculture activities grew by 4.8 per

cent in 2018 against 0.4 per cent contraction

recorded in 2017. The favourable weather conditions

that prevailed in major cultivation areas throughout

the year spurred the recovery in Agriculture activities

as witnessed mainly by the substantial increase in

the growing of rice, fruits, oleaginous fruits (coconut,

king coconut, oil palm) and spices during the year.

Further, animal production, growing of vegetables,

growing of other beverage crops (coffee, cocoa etc.),

growing of cereals and, plant propagation and support

activities to agriculture contributed positively to the

growth of Agriculture. However, fishing activities,

growing of other perennial crops, growing of tea,

forestry and logging, growing of sugarcane, tobacco

and other non-perennial crops and growing of rubber

contracted in 2018, compared to the previous year.

Favorable base effect also contributed to the higher

growth in the Agricultural activities.

Agriculture Production Index

The Agriculture Production Index, which

measures the output of the Agriculture and

Fisheries sectors, recorded a growth of 10.7 per

cent in 2018, compared to a decline of 10.7 per

cent in 2017. Within the index, the sub-indices of

paddy, coconut and other crops (fruits, vegetables

and other field crops) increased, while tea and rubber

sub-indices declined in comparison to the previous

year. Meanwhile, activities in the livestock sector

grew, while a contraction was recorded in fisheries

activities.

Paddy

Total paddy production of the country grew

significantly in 2018 amidst favourable weather

conditions. Paddy production, which was affected

by adverse weather conditions, in 2017, recovered

with an increase of 64.9 per cent, resulting in a

production of 3.9 million metric tons during 2018.

The net extent harvested during the year increased

by 59.5 per cent to 884,555 hectares, resulting in an

increase in the average yield to 4,443 kilogrammes

per hectare. Compared to the previous Maha

season, paddy production during the 2017/18

Maha season recorded an increase of 62.6

per cent to 2.4 million metric tons. The net extent

harvested during this season was 557,221 hectares,

which was a 62.6 per cent increase compared to the

2016/17 Maha season. The increase in the cultivation

extent together with favourable weather conditions

during the season supported the marginal increase

in the average yield of paddy to 4,302 kilogrammes

per hectare, in comparison to 4,301 kilogrammes

per hectare recorded in the previous Maha season.

Meanwhile, paddy production during the 2018 Yala

season increased by 68.6 per cent to 1.5 million

metric tons. The net extent harvested during the 2018

Yala season was 327,334 hectares, and this was a

54.5 per cent expansion compared to the previous

Yala season, while the average yield of paddy

increased from 4,291 kilogrammes per hectare in

the 2017 Yala season to 4,683 kilogrammes per

hectare during the 2018 Yala season. Despite crop

damages due to the impact of drought, pest attacks

and diseases, the significant improvement in paddy

production in both the Yala and Maha seasons

were the result of conducive weather conditions and

sufficient availability of water for paddy cultivation

during the period.

Rice imports witnessed a considerable decline

in 2018 due to the availability of sufficient stocks

in the domestic paddy market. Total rice milled

was estimated at 2.5 million metric tons, which was

sufficient to meet the household rice requirement of

the country for around 13 months. Accordingly, total

rice imports decreased by 66.7 per cent, compared

to the previous year. During 2018, 248,901 metric

tons of rice was imported at a total cost of US dollars

106.8 million and around 95 per cent of this rice was

imported in the first four months of the year.

Paddy and rice prices of selected varieties

remained elevated during 2018. Samba paddy

prices, which remained elevated during the first

half of the year amidst limited supply to the market,

showed a decreasing trend during the latter part of

the year, following the increased harvest from the

2017/18 Maha season. Average price of Samba

paddy marginally increased to Rs. 51.04 per

kilogramme during 2018, while Nadu paddy recorded

a decline from Rs. 49.57 per kilogramme in 2017 to

Rs. 40.17 per kilogramme in 2018. The guaranteed

paddy purchasing price for Samba and Nadu varieties

were Rs. 41.00 per kilogramme and Rs. 38.00

per kilogramme, respectively, in 2018. Although the

supply of rice increased, the average price of selected

rice varieties increased during 2018, highlighting the

need for competitive markets. The average retail

price of Samba rice was Rs.109.24 per kilogramme

during the year 2018, which was an increase of

10.7 per cent from the previous year. Meanwhile, the

average retail price of Nadu rice was Rs. 91.94 per

kilogramme, which was an increase of 1.1 per cent

compared to the same period of the previous year.

Tea

Unfavourable weather conditions in tea

growing areas, particularly during the months

of May and June 2018, and wage related trade

union action in the plantation sector affected

the total tea production during the year.

Accordingly, total tea production decreased by

1.0 per cent to 303.8 million kilogrammes in 2018

from 307.1 million kilogrammes in 2017. Low

grown tea production, which accounts for 63.2

per cent of the total production, decreased by 2.7

per cent to 192.0 million kilogrammes, while the

production of high grown tea and medium grown

tea increased by 1.3 per cent to 64.8 million

kilogrammes and 3.0 per cent to 47.0 million

kilogrammes, respectively. In the meantime, the

tea smallholder sector recorded a decline in the

average yield of made tea to 1,958 kilogrammes

per hectare from 1,995 kilogrammes per hectare

in 2017. Orthodox tea and value added tea

production recorded a decline of 1.9 per cent

and 1.7 per cent, respectively, while CTC tea

production increased by 9.6 per cent during 2018.

A declining trend in tea prices was recorded

from early 2018 and continued till the end of the

year. Average auction prices of high, medium and

low grown teas at the Colombo Tea Auction (CTA)

were significantly lower than the corresponding

prices that were observed in 2017. During 2018,

the average price of tea decreased to Rs. 581.58

per kilogramme from Rs. 620.44 per kilogrammes

in 2017. The highest year-on-year decrease in

tea prices at the CTA was observed for medium

grown tea (8.0 per cent), followed by high grown

tea (6.3 per cent) and low grown tea (5.9 per

cent). The average export price (FOB) recorded

a decrease of 4.4 per cent to US dollars 5.06 per

kilogramme in 2018, compared with US dollars

5.29 per kilogramme in 2017. Meanwhile, Iraq was

the major importer of Sri Lankan tea, followed by

Turkey and Russia. Comparatively low demand

during 2018 from exporters adversely affected tea

exports. Accordingly, total tea exports decreased

by 2.3 per cent to 282.4 million kilogrammes in

2018, compared to 289.0 million kilogrammes in

the previous year.

Rubber

Rubber production declined by 0.6 per

cent to 82.6 million kilogrammes in 2018 from

83.1 million kilogrammes produced in 2017.

Continuous rain in plantation areas that prevailed

during tapping days along with the high cost of

production and poor management of plantations

contributed to the drop in total rubber production

in 2018. During the first half of 2018, rubber

production showed a declining trend, while rubber

production improved considerably thereafter,

supported by favourable weather conditions in

major rubber growing areas. The production of

sheet rubber, which accounts for about 50.0

per cent share of total rubber production, declined

by 0.5 per cent to 41.3 million kilogrammes from

41.5 million kilogrammes in 2017. Crepe rubber

production recorded a considerable growth of 26.2

per cent to 14.5 million kilogrammes. Production

of other categories of rubber, which accounts for

32.4 per cent of total rubber production, declined

by 11.1 per cent to 26.8 million kilogrammes, in

comparison to the previous year’s production

of 30.1 million kilogrammes. Domestic usage of

rubber for local industries increased by 5.6 per cent

to 135.2 million kilogrammes in 2018. Meanwhile,

exports of raw rubber recorded a decline of 18.9

per cent to 14.0 million kilogrammes during 2018.

Reflecting the drop in international market prices

in 2018, rubber prices in the domestic market

also showed a declining trend during 2018. At the

Colombo Rubber Auction, the average price of

Ribbed Smoked Sheet No.1 (RSS1) declined by

8.2 per cent to Rs. 309.09 per kilogramme, while

prices of latex crepe declined by 8.5 per cent to

Rs. 321.70 per kilogramme. Low rubber prices in the

international market and lower domestic production

resulted in an increase of raw rubber imports from

61.8 million kilogrammes in 2017 to 65.8 million

kilogrammes during 2018 to meet the requirements

on rubber based industries in the country.

Coconut

Coconut production recovered from its

declining trend in 2018, due to the lagged

effect of favourable rainfall experienced in

major coconut growing areas in 2017. Although

coconut production that remained subdued

during the first quarter of the year, recorded an

expansion thereafter resulting in an overall growth

of 7.1 per cent to 2,623 million nuts during 2018.

Due to low supplies during the first half of the

year, production volumes of many coconut based

products decreased in 2018, compared to 2017.

Accordingly, desiccated coconut (DC) production

decreased significantly by 16.7 per cent in 2018.

Similarly, coconut oil production also declined by

14.6 per cent in 2018, largely due to the reduction in

coconut oil production by small and medium scale

mills owing to high cost of production. Meanwhile,

palm oil imports, a close substitute for coconut

oil, increased by 11.5 per cent in 2018, induced

by lower domestic coconut oil production and

the decline in global palm oil prices. Meanwhile,

production of coconut cream, coconut milk powder

and coconut milk grew by 13.4 per cent in 2018,

reflecting high export demand for these products.

Further, production of virgin coconut oil was also

affected by limited availability of nuts, resulting in

a 13.1 per cent decline in its production. Reflecting

higher demand from domestic manufacturers for

coconut products and increased export demand

amidst supply shortages in the world market,

coconut prices increased, particularly during the

first nine months of 2018. However, with increased

supplies in the last quarter of 2018, the average

wholesale price of coconut declined marginally

to Rs. 60.68 per nut in 2018, from Rs. 62.71 per

nut in 2017. High farmgate prices of coconut,

mostly reported in the first nine months, resulted

in increasing the retail price of coconut as well as

the cost of production of coconut based products.

The average retail price of a coconut increased

to Rs. 69.71 per nut in 2018 from Rs. 67.40

per nut in 2017, while the average price of coconut

oil remained broadly unchanged. The average

FOB price of desiccated coconut increased to

Rs. 430.84 per kilogramme in 2018 from Rs. 387.35

per kilogramme in 2017. Meanwhile, DC exporters

were unable to harness the full benefit of increased

prices due to low domestic production, as reflected

by the decline of around 28 per cent in DC exports

during 2018.

Minor Export Crops

The performance of minor export crops

continued to weaken in 2018 as in the previous

year. Although the production of cinnamon, cocoa,

arecanut, citronella and turmeric recorded a growth,

the production of pepper, clove, cardamom, coffee,

nutmeg, betel and ginger declined considerably during

2018, compared to 2017. Despite the increase in

extent under minor export crops by 1.9 per cent, total

production decreased by 14.3 per cent to 101,718

metric tons during 2018. This decline in production

was mainly due to dry weather and the unusual shift

in the rainfall pattern in growing areas. Accordingly,

pepper production decreased by 31.9 per cent to

20,135 metric tons mainly due to unfavourable

weather conditions in major pepper growing areas

during the flowering and fruiting period. Meanwhile,

both farmgate and auction prices of pepper dropped

significantly by around 30 per cent due to the declining

trend in world market prices and the issue due to

the importation of low quality pepper that was then

re-exported under trade agreements. However, cocoa

production improved significantly by 38.9 per cent to

654 metric tons and cinnamon production grew by

3.0 per cent to 23,019 metric tons during the year,

supported by the increase in the cultivation extent in

recent years. The total export volume of minor export

crops dropped by 19.6 per cent, along with an 11.3

per cent reduction in earnings to US dollars 360.2

million during 2018, compared to the previous year.

Despite exports of many crops such as pepper, clove,

cardamom, cocoa, betel and arecanut recording

a decline in 2018, cinnamon exports showed a

continuous growth and reached 17,537 metric

tons with 5.5 per cent increase over the previous

year. Meanwhile, the importation of minor export

crops including pepper, cocoa, turmeric and ginger

increased by 12.0 per cent and import expenditure

increased by around 8.9 per cent in 2018.

Other Field Crops

The production of other field crops (OFCs)

increased amidst crop damages due to adverse

weather conditions and pest attacks that

prevailed in certain parts of the country during

the year. The overall production of OFCs increased

by 19.2 per cent in 2018 to 606,926 metric tons

from 509,076 metric tons in 2017. This was the

combined outcome of a growth of 42.3 per cent in the

2017/18 Maha season and a 14.4 per cent decline

in the 2018 Yala season. The output of maize, finger

millet (kurakkan), potatoes, green gram, black gram,

ground nut and cowpea increased in 2018, compared

to the previous year, while the production of big

onion, soya bean and sorghum recorded a negative

growth, which prompted increased imports of these

crops. Big onion production declined by 47.7 per cent

during the year, and consequently, imports of big

onion increased by 6.0 per cent to 246,237 metric

tons. Although the potato production increased by

21.2 per cent to 88,897 metric tons in 2018, potato

imports also increased by 4.8 per cent, supported by

low prices in the global market along with increased

domestic demand. It is expected that the improved

local supply of OFCs would support domestic

industries that use such produce, dampening the

demand for imports. However, in order to strengthen

domestic food security, further efforts are required

to improve the supply of all OFCs by promoting

off-seasonal production, expanding storage capacity,

strengthening extension services as well as research

and development activities on seed production, pest

management and quarantine services, and adopting

best practices on climate resilient agriculture.

Meanwhile, maize and finger millet production

was severely affected during the last quarter of the

year due to the ‘Sena’ caterpillar infestation, and it

is expected that the production of these crops will

decline in the 2018/19 Maha season.

Vegetables

According to the estimates of the Department

of Census and Statistics, vegetable production

increased to 1.7 million metric tons in 2018,

registering a growth of 13.3 per cent amidst

weather related disturbances during some periods

of the year. This was supported by an increase of

20.6 per cent in the 2017/18 Maha season and a

4.6 per cent growth during the 2018 Yala season.

Meanwhile, there were wide fluctuations in vegetable

prices throughout the year owing to both drought

and flood conditions that prevailed in some parts of

the country. Weather related setbacks experienced

during the second quarter of 2018 resulted in crop

damages, reducing the market supply and elevating

prices of many vegetable varieties. Meanwhile, during

the third quarter of 2018, prices increased displaying

the regular seasonal pattern, while rainy weather

conditions substantially disturbed harvesting and

transporting of vegetables during the end of the fourth

quarter of the year. However, amidst these weather

related disturbances, the supply of vegetables

increased during the peak harvesting period of

the Maha season as well as the Yala season, thus

lowering prices. During 2018, 25.8 million kilogrammes

of vegetables worth Rs. 4.6 billion were exported,

while 738.2 million kilogrammes of vegetables worth

Rs. 49.1 billion were imported. Meanwhile, pest

attacks became a major issue in vegetable cultivation,

and measures are required to address this issue in

order to protect the farmers and the consumers, as

well as to increase the sustainability of the sector.

Fruits

The production of fruits increased in 2018,

with significant contributions from avocado,

orange, guava, rambutan and lime. Fruit

production recorded a significant growth of 28.8

per cent in 2018, compared to the growth of 9.5

per cent in the previous year. During the year, 37.3

million kilogrammes of fruits worth Rs. 6.3 billion

were exported, while 78.7 million kilogrammes of

fresh fruits, including apples, mandarins, oranges

and grapes valued at Rs. 14.2 billion were

imported. Fruit cultivation in Sri Lanka is spread

over 150,000 hectares, while a large share of

this extent is cultivated in home gardens. Due to

poor planning in cultivation of fruits and lack of

awareness, contribution to national development

by fruit production still remains low. Increasing

effectiveness of fruit cultivation, ensuring quality

of products and meeting market demand for fruits

with better awareness among farmers on ground

conditions are key issues that need to be addressed

in developing this sector.

Sugar

The slowdown witnessed in sugar production

in 2017, continued during 2018 as well. Total

domestic sugar production registered a decline of

7.7 per cent to 51,265 metric tons during the period

under review, compared to a slowdown of 9.3 per

cent recorded in 2017. Accordingly, around 720,259

metric tons of sugarcane were crushed in 2018

compared to 746,607 metric tons recorded in 2017.

Total sugar produced at the Sevanagala factory

during 2018 was 14,709 metric tons, compared

to 15,198 metric tons recorded in previous year.

Production at the Pelwatta factory, which is based

on rainfed cane supply, witnessed an increase of

1.5 per cent to 28,061 metric tons, while the Gal

Oya (Hingurana) factory recorded a production

decline of 33.2 per cent to 8,495 metric tons during

the period under review. The estimated share of

output from the Sevanagala, Pelwatta, and Gal

Oya factories to the overall national production

was around 29 per cent, 54 per cent and 17

per cent, respectively. Sugar recovery rate1,

which is considered as an indicator of the

productivity in the sugar sector, declined to 7.1

per cent in 2018 from 7.4 per cent in 2017.

Meanwhile, imports of sugar also increased by

29.5 per cent to 644,675 metric tons in 2018 from

497,952 metric tons in 2017, on account of low

domestic production and low prices witnessed in

the international market. Overall, domestic sugar

manufacturers were able to meet around nine

per cent of the sugar demand of the country in

2018, in comparison to ten per cent in 2017, while

the remaining domestic demand was met through

imports.

Fisheries

The fisheries sector witnessed a marginal

setback in 2018. Total fish production showed a

decline of 0.8 per cent to 527,060 metric tons during

2018, compared to the marginal expansion of

0.1 per cent recorded in 2017. The contraction

in fish production was mainly attributed to

the decline in marine fish production. Marine

fish production, which accounts for around 83

per cent of total fish production, witnessed a

decline of 2.2 per cent to 439,370 metric tons

in 2018, largely due to the drop in coastal and

lagoon fish production. Meanwhile, offshore fish

production increased marginally. Adverse weather

conditions that prevailed during the second

quarter of 2018 in the Western and Southern

coastal areas adversely affected the operations

of the day boats and thereby, affected marine

fish production. However, inland fish production

that contributed around 17 per cent to the total fish

production showed an increase of 7.1 per cent to

87,690 metric tons in 2018 compared to the previous

year. The increased release of fingerlings to tanks

that was supported by the recovery in water levels

in major reservoirs in the early part of 2018, better

management of aquaculture resources and proper

monitoring largely contributed to the improvements

in the inland fisheries sector. In 2018, around

112 million of fingerlings were produced, which

is an increase of around 35 per cent, compared

to the previous year. Meanwhile, the production

in the shrimp farms subcategory also increased

considerably during the period under review, while

the aquaculture category witnessed a decline of

2.9 per cent to 8,490 metric tons. In response to the

decline in production, prices of large fish varieties

registered a marginal increase of 0.7 per cent, while

small fish varieties recorded an increase of 15.2

per cent during 2018, in comparison to the previous

year. In the meantime, export earnings from fish

products in terms of value, witnessed an increase

of 10.5 per cent to US dollars 265.8 million and

6.6 per cent in terms of volume to 25,949 metric

tons during 2018, reflecting the continued positive

impact of the removal of the ban on fish exports to

the EU market. Meanwhile, fish imports witnessed

a decline of 20.4 per cent to 84,206 metric tons in

2018 from 105,745 metric tons recorded in 2017.

Livestock

Total milk production recorded a notable

expansion in 2018. Accordingly, total milk

production increased by 19.0 per cent to 471.6

million litres in 2018, compared to 396.2 million

litres in 2017. Cow milk production increased by

17.7 per cent to 385.7 million litres, while buffalo

milk production increased by 25.3 per cent to 85.9

million litres in comparison to 2017. Meanwhile, milk

production at the National Livestock Development

Board (NLDB) decreased to 14.7 million litres in

2018, from 15.0 million litres in the previous year.

The number of milking cows increased by 11.2

per cent to 329,380, while the number of milking

buffalo cows increased by 8.9 per cent to 94,200

during 2018. Despite increased production, milk

powder imports grew by 6.3 per cent to 99,028

metric tons at a value of Rs. 50.3 billion during

2018. Since domestic milk production is only

sufficient to meet around 45 per cent of the total

demand of the country, it is essential to address the

existing issues in the sector while encouraging milk

producers to enhance their production capacity.

Meanwhile, the average cost of milk production

increased to Rs. 47.67 per litre due to the price

increase of concentrate feeds, while the average

farmgate price remained broadly unchanged at

Rs. 66.88 per litre as in the previous year.

Egg production declined, while meat

production recorded a mixed performance

during 2018. Egg production decreased by 4.9

per cent to 1,972.2 million eggs in 2018, compared

to 2,072.9 million eggs in 2017. Meanwhile, the

cost of production of a large scale egg producer

increased by 3.7 per cent to Rs. 12.80 in 2018.

Chicken production recorded an increase of 2.4

per cent to 205,820 metric tons during 2018, from

200,980 metric tons in 2017, while the cost of

production of chicken increased from Rs. 245.32 per

kilogramme to Rs. 265.85 per kilogramme during

2018. Further, broiler parent imports increased

Agriculture Policies and Institutional Support

The government policy on agriculture

as envisaged in the 'National Agriculture

Policy' continued with the aim of achieving

food security in the country. Accordingly, the

Crop Production and Forecasting Programme,

the National Food Security Programme and the

Organic Fertiliser Production Programme continued

during the year together with the Agriculture Sector

Modernisation Project. Meanwhile, the Climate

Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project, which is funded

by the World Bank, was initiated in six provinces

with the objective of implementing climate resilient

agriculture systems in the country. Further,

considering the high proportion of crop damages

caused by wild animals, the Ministry of Agriculture

focused its attention on the management of wildlife

and the prevention of crop damages. Meanwhile,

considering the high post-harvest losses, the

government initiated the establishment of a

temperature controlled storage facility adjacent to

the Dambulla Economic Centre to reduce volatility

in supplies and prices of perishable farm produce

by ensuring proper storage. The government

continued to implement several policy measures

as proposed in the Budget 2018, mainly focusing

on shifting the agriculture sector into a more

productive, eco-friendly and export oriented sector.

The Budget 2019 proposed measures to promote

agri-business value chains for the infusion of

technology and to develop high value crops. The

government has earmarked Rs. 400 million to set up

modern climate-controlled warehousing facilities in

Katunayake, Embilipitiya, Jaffna and Keppetipola.

Further, Rs. 250 million has been allocated to

expand the Agriculture Modernisation Project in five

new districts. The Budget also proposed several

measures to develop the cinnamon and rubber

industries, coconut based products, fisheries sector

and irrigation infrastructure.

The Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB), the Tea

Small Holdings Development Authority (TSHDA)

and the Tea Research Institute (TRI) followed

their regulatory and development activities

for the improvement of the tea sector, with

emphasis on productivity and technological

enhancements throughout 2018. The SLTB

continued to provide financial assistance under

the brand promotion scheme and facilitated the

participation of Sri Lankan tea exporting companies

in international trade fairs in selected markets,

promoting both ‘Ceylon Tea’ as a country brand and

private individual brands. The SLTB also carried

out the registration and renewal of the Ceylon

The SLTB encouraged trade exhibitions and

events during the year under review and conducted

promotional activities such as media campaigns,

outdoor advertising, global promotional campaigns,

and Ceylon Tea Forum and Tasting, while facilitating

and hosting a delegation from Russia. Meanwhile,

the TSHDA continued the implementation of their tea

replanting and new planting programmes, and crop

rehabilitation subsidy programmes during 2018 as

well. The TSHDA conducted a range of extension

and awareness programmes for stakeholders with

the aim of enhancing tea production. In addition,

the TSHDA recommended loans for tea replanting

and tea new planting under the 'Special Bank Loan

Scheme' implemented by the Bank of Ceylon for

tea small holders, in order to promote investment

of their holdings. Accordingly, 1,027 hectares were

replanted in tea small holdings at a subsidised rate

of Rs. 500,000 per hectare, while 435 hectares

were newly planted during 2018. As per the

TRI Strategic Plan 2018 – 2020, research and

development strategies and extension activities

were undertaken by the TRI to improve the tea

sector. Under the strategic plan, a special project

was established to multiply and disseminate quality

planting material of newly developed tea cultivars

and improved seed material among tea small

holders. Land productivity improvement through

integrated soil fertility management approaches

and agronomic practices, popularising mechanical

harvesters and other devices in the small holding

sector, and diversifying products from off grades

were carried out by the TRI during the year.

Moreover, a project was initiated to disseminate

four cultivars developed by the TRI 5000 series to

the upcountry region. A Soil Quality Index (SQI)

has been developed by the TRI, considering

physical, chemical and biological properties of soil,

and the TRI investigated on critical control points

in black and green tea processing, and chemical

and microbial standards of tea to ensure product

quality. It has been recognised that low productivity

of land, labour issues, high cost of production,

post-harvest damage, inadequate facilities in tea

factories, low quality tea production and unstable

tea prices have adversely impacted the production

of tea. Moreover, tea production is highly labour

intensive and the industry faced low labour

productivity, labour scarcity and high labour costs

as well as trade union action during 2018 as well.

The Rubber Development Department (RDD)

and Rubber Research Institute (RRI) continued

their research and development activities with

a view to increasing natural rubber production

in 2018. The strategic plan of RDD focused on

increasing natural rubber production up to 200,000

metric tons annually by year 2040 from the current

annual production of around 83,000 metric tons.

Productivity improvement and expansion of

rubber cultivation to non-traditional areas were

the main strategies implemented in this regard

during 2018. To compensate for the low rubber

prices prevailing in the market, the RRI introduced

farming systems that enable the farmers to have

an additional income, popularised low frequency

tapping systems to reduce labour costs and

overall cost of production and popularised

rain-guards in the rubber plantations to generate

more revenue. A special capital project was received

by the RRI for establishing sustainable rubber

cultivations with a variety of intercrops. Under this

scheme, seven farmer fields were established in

Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Moneragala, and Ampara

districts. A research grant was received from the

National Research Council (NRC) to investigate

physiological and molecular biological aspects of

rubber plants to enhance growth and yield under

abiotic stress conditions, while a new project on

analysing the effect of gaseous stimulation on latex

and dry rubber properties commenced at Pimbura

Estate in Agalawatta. Although the value addition

of raw rubber has been promoted continuously,

the rubber production sector suffers from lack of

competitiveness with low productivity levels due to

the poor adoption of accepted agro management

practices. Moreover, low and volatile market prices

for natural rubber, high cost of production, high

labour costs, labour shortages including lack of

skilled tappers and adverse weather conditions

are the issues highlighted by stakeholders in the

rubber sector.

Within the coconut sector, institutional

support was further strengthened to promote

new planting and replanting, upgrading

and promoting research activities in related

institutions, and implementing measures to

improve productivity through adaptations

to climate change. Under the subsidy scheme

for replanting and new planting, around

Rs. 274 million were disbursed during the year.

Accordingly, replanting and under planting

areas were 4,549 hectares, while new planting

areas stood at 8,198 hectares. Meanwhile, the

temporary discontinuation of issuing approvals

on fresh coconut exports, which was effective

since June 2017, due to a severe fresh coconut

shortage in the domestic market was removed on

01 September 2018, considering the satisfactory

performance of the sector. As the production

levels recovered with a view to promote fresh

nut exports, the service charge collected by

the Coconut Development Authority (CDA) on

fresh nut exports was reduced to Rs. 8.00 from

Rs. 15.00 per nut. Moreover, during the year,

the import tariff on coconut oil was increased

from Rs. 130.00 per kilogramme to Rs. 170.00

per kilogramme, while the import tariff on

crude palm oil was increased from Rs. 110.00

per kilogramme to Rs. 150.00 per kilogramme,

with the aim of safeguarding the domestic coconut

oil industry. Although the tariff revisions are likely

to have a positive impact on the domestic oil

industry, production of coconut oil did not recover

completely after the stoppage of production by oil

mills during the early part of the year due to high

fresh nut prices. Meanwhile, capital expenditure

incurred by government institutions for coconut

sector development amounted to Rs. 844 million

in 2018 in comparison to Rs. 772 million in 2017.

Further, the Coconut Research Institute (CRI)

continued its research activities to improve

productivity, crop conservation and introduce

new coconut-based products, while contributing

to control the spread of the Weligama Coconut

Leaf Wilt Disease (WCLWD). Under technology

transfer activities, the CRI conducted the annual

'Certificate Course on Coconut Cultivation and

2

Value Addition' for coconut growers, conducted

series of workshops on increasing productivity to

both state and private sector coconut plantations

and successfully completed the first 'International

Certificate Course on Coconut Plantation

Management' jointly with the International

Coconut Community (ICC).

Several measures were introduced to

increase the yield and production of export

agriculture crops. Measures implemented by

the Department of Export Agriculture (DEA)

mainly targeted to expand new planting activities

while improving the yield of existing cultivations.

Further, the DEA continued to provide high quality

planting material at a subsidised rate together

with technical assistance and extension services

to growers in 2018. Meanwhile, ‘Danasaviya’

economic home garden programme, which was

implemented to strengthen the economy of women

through the cultivation of export agriculture crops

in their home gardens continued in 2018.

During the year, the Department of

Agriculture (DOA) continued to carry out

a number of programmes focusing on

promoting domestic agriculture to achieve

self-sufficiency, while managing the

impact from climate change on agriculture

production. During 2018, a new drought

resistant seed paddy variety was released for

local cultivation, while three new varieties of

other field crops (onion / green gram) were also

released. In addition, the certified seed production

and purchasing programme, plant quarantine

services and the Good Agriculture Practices

(GAP) strengthening programmes continued in

2018, as well. The government took measures

to reintroduce the fertiliser subsidy programme

from the 2018 Yala season onwards replacing

the fertiliser cash grant scheme, considering

the requests made by stakeholders. Further, a

central analytical laboratory was established at

the Horticulture Crop Research and Development

Institute to strengthen the laboratory services.

Research activities of the Institute of

Post-Harvest Technology (IPHT) continued in

2018, and sixteen research projects were carried

out during the year. Further, extension activities

of the IPHT on disseminating technology

continued. Meanwhile, the IPHT introduced

vacuum dehydrated technology for selected

vegetable and fruit varieties, with the view of

reducing post-harvest losses. Moreover, fifteen

commercial level fruit villages have been set

up and agricultural equipment were distributed

to maintain the existing fruit villages under the

'Fruit Village Development Programme'. The

DOA, with the technical support of International

Financial Corporation (IFC) affiliated to the World

Bank, devised plans to implement an index

based insurance scheme for paddy cultivation.

The first stage of this project was implemented

on a trial basis in the Vavuniya district and

Mahaweli H Zone in Anuradhapura district during

2018. Further, a compulsory insurance scheme

for Paddy, Soya, Potato, Maize, Big Onion and

Chillies was implemented according to 2018

budget proposals. The government allocated Rs.

250 million as compensation for farms affected

by the Fall Armyworm, and Rs. 40,000 per acre

was paid for the farms that were affected. In the

view of promoting professional agriculture, an

event to showcase ground breaking innovative

agriculture technology of the world to modernise

the agriculture sector in Sri Lanka, the Ministry of

Agriculture organised ‘Harvest 2018’, a modern

agriculture exhibition under the 'Agriculture

Sector Modernisation Project'.

The Need to Strengthen the Agriculture Quarantine FrameworkThe recent outbreak of the Fall Armyworm (‘Sena’ caterpillar) infestation, which drastically damaged the maize production of the country in late 2018, has, once again, highlighted the vulnerability of Sri Lanka’s agriculture sector to frequent exogenous disturbances. While the agriculture sector suffers from low levels of productivity due to longstanding structural issues that need to be addressed through land and labour market reforms, the recurrence of adverse effects arising from extreme weather conditions, infectious diseases and pest attacks indicates the need for focused efforts to protect the agriculture sector to strengthen food security of the country. The protection of agricultural production is essential in order to minimise undue escalation in food prices and the cost of living, reduce the import bill for food, weedicides and pesticides, as well as to realise the true export potential of the agriculture sector.The growth in international trade and transport between countries and regions has increased the risk of pests, diseases and weeds spreading globally. Species, which were previously capable of diffusing only over short distances by natural processes, can now be transferred from country to country or from one geographical region to another with greater ease. Even in the past when mobility was limited, these invasive pests introduced through trade activities have damaged crops and even created famines in different parts of the world. The Ireland famine that occurred in the middle of the 18th Century was a result of the total failure of the potato crop due to the introduction of late blight pathogen from Central America. Moreover, the introduction of mildew, from America, in quick succession around the middle of the 19th Century, virtually destroyed the grape vine industry of France. In Sri Lanka, coffee was replaced by tea as a plantation crop because of the destruction caused by the spreading of coffee leaf rust disease in 1868, while cinchona that was used to treat malaria was devastated by Heloplice antonieso. In addition, about 20,000 hectares of coconut plantations, in Sri Lanka, were devastated by the invasion of Coconut leafminer during the late 1960s. More recently, Weligama coconut leaf wilt disease, caused by Phytoplasma, destroyed coconut plantations in Southern Sri Lanka. The Fall Armyworm, which had a devastating effect on Sri Lanka’s maize crop, is indigenous to the American tropical and subtropical regions, and first spread to Africa where it was detected in Nigeria, in January 2016, and across all of sub-Saharan Africa thereafter. The pest then spread to Asia, and it is believed that it was spread to Sri Lanka in 2018 through trade and air transport channels from India. Control measures against the pest have been taken to prevent further crop damage with the aid of integrated pest management systems. Furthermore, recent restrictions on some of Sri

BOX 4A Stronger Agriculture Quarantine Framework to Improve Resilience of the Agriculture Sector

Lanka’s agricultural exports by major export destinations also display the vulnerabilities Sri Lanka faces due to inadequate quarantine procedures. Such increased risks and vulnerabilities highlight the urgent need to strengthen the country’s plant protection framework and quarantine procedures at borders in order to minimise the adverse effects on the agriculture sector arising from alien species being introduced to the country knowingly or unknowingly through the import of food items, seeds, plants as well as live animals.

Quarantine Regulations in Sri Lanka

Plant quarantine laws, regulations and services are based on national and international agreements, which evolved, during the 19th and 20th Centuries, around the world with a view to ensuring the safe trade of agricultural products across the globe. The plant quarantine system of Sri Lanka originated under the British rule in 1880s, and at present there are a number of regulatory and operational activities that are designed to prevent the entry, establishment and spread of pests in Sri Lanka. The National Plant Quarantine Service (NPQS), which functions under the Seed Certification and Plant Protection Centre of the Department of Agriculture, is responsible for plant quarantine activities. NPQS engages in domestic pest control programmes, development of treatment technologies to eradicate pests of quarantine importance, and promotion of import and export of healthy plants and plant products. Further, services such as pest diagnostics and detection, training and awareness programmes and plant quarantine related research are carried out by NPQS. The NPQS stations also provide quarantine processes such as the issuance of permits for the importation of plants and plant products based on the import conditions, issuance of phytosanitary certificates, inspection of import and export cargo of plant and plant products, handling of post-entry quarantine activities, coordination with stakeholders on plant quarantine matters and advisory services, import risk analysis, and identification of diseases, insects and pests.

The main legal instruments available in Sri Lanka to tackle issues related to invasive pests are the Water Hyacinth Ordinance No. 4 of 1909, Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance No. 2 of 1937 (as amended), Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act, No. 02 of 1996 (as amended), Plant Protection Act No. 35 of 1999, Prevention of Mosquito Breeding Act No. 11 of 2007 and Marine Pollution Prevention Act No. 35 of 2008. Since new regulations under the Plant Protection Act are not yet issued, those made under the Plant Protection Ordinance are still in operation. The Plant Protection Act intends to prevent the introduction and spread of any organism injurious or harmful to plants or destructive to plants found in Sri Lanka.

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

This Act defines 'invasive' to include all active, infective and dormant stages of life forms that could be harmful to plant life. This includes not only plants but organisms as well. Further, several government institutions have developed policy statements of mechanisms to tackle the issues, including those related to quarantine pests in Sri Lanka, such as the National Wildlife Policy, the National Environmental Policy, and the National Agriculture Policy. However, considering the importance of the development and implementation of an effective framework to support the country’s efforts to manage pests, the government approved a new National Policy on Invasive Alien Species, and the strategies and action plan for its implementation was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in March 2016. However, the action plan is yet to be implemented.

International Standards on Plant Protection

In implementing and strengthening frameworks to take immediate action against invasive pests, it is important to ensure that Sri Lanka’s standards are in line with relevant global conventions. The World Trade Organisation (WTO), Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), and International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships are the key International organisations and Conventions that focus on plant protection. The IPPC has created a governing body known as the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures (CPM), which oversees the implementation of the Convention. The Convention is recognised by the WTO's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement) as the only international standard setting body for plant health. The IPPC's primary focus is on plants and plant products moving in international trade. Member countries of IPPC are expected to maintain inspection procedures for export and undertake eradication and control measures in the event new pest infestations occur. IPPC encourages governments to take all steps necessary to implement regulations, while member countries are required to establish a National Plant Protection Organisation (NPPO) within the country to promote safe agricultural trade. International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPMs) of IPPC are the key elements to facilitate the process of developing international standards for plant quarantine. This programme makes available to members of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and other interested parties the standards, guidelines and recommendations to achieve international harmonisation of phytosanitary measures, with the aim of facilitating trade and avoiding the use of unjustifiable measures that operate as barriers to trade.

Measures to Strengthen Sri Lanka’s Quarantine FrameworkEven though Sri Lanka is a member of IPPC and follows the standards and regulations of phytosanitary measures, the numerous instances of crop damages particularly in recent times show that the country is lagging behind in implementing international standards

in quarantine activities. Strengthening national legal and institutional frameworks, building research capacity, developing a system of environmental risk analysis, building public awareness and engagement, and promoting international cooperation are among the strategies that are needed to enhance the quarantine services of Sri Lanka. Plant protection institutions are constrained by the inadequacy of technology, equipment and trained workforce to upgrade quarantine services to the required level. The policy and regulatory framework for minimising the risks still remains under-developed and not well coordinated. There is a necessity to formulate and review the existing Acts, regulations and policies at national level to support the NPQS and strengthen it as an independent government agency. Responsible institutions should be harmonised with policies and regulations to build up a national level quarantine framework. Introduction of appropriate incentive mechanisms for strengthening the agriculture quarantine framework is also an essential step to protect the country’s agriculture production. Further, there is a need for capacity building and networking of crop specialists, entomologists, environmentalists and plant quarantine specialists to address the issues posed by invasive pests. Capacity building efforts should be focused to build basic awareness through appropriate training programmes among immigration officials, quarantine officials, customs, food inspection authorities and stakeholders. In addition, awareness programmes for importers, exporters and the general public are necessary to educate them on the importance of protecting national plant resources and the national phytosanitary regulations. Further, strengthening the research capacity to analyse risks and develop improved techniques to eradicate invasive pests through environmentally sustainable strategies is also required. An effective mechanism for information exchange, surveillance, monitoring and early warning systems for the prevention and eradication of pests needs to be developed with the help of all stakeholders. Moreover, rapid initial detection of pests both during initial inspection procedures and field surveillance is essential to minimise the effects of pests. New methods for pest detection such as remote pest identification using digital imaging, X-ray scanning techniques, sniffer dogs, etc. need to be practiced in Sri Lanka as well. Rapid response mechanisms with appropriate risk analysis and environmental assessment to tackle the incursion of invasive pests are essential to build up most effective quarantine services. Moreover, promoting domestic seed production could also help develop agricultural products that are more suitable for Sri Lanka while reducing pests that could enter through seed imports. An effective quarantine framework that includes the aspects discussed above is essential, if the agriculture sector is to progress as a resilient sector in the economy.

The Sugarcane Research Institute (SRI)

continued its research activities and extension

services aimed at strengthening local sugar

industry. Establishing nurseries, conducting training

programmes and monitoring of sugarcane plantations

established under sugar factories continued, while

carrying out pest controlling activities mainly to control

Fall Armyworm attacks on sugar cane cultivation.

Meanwhile, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the

setting up of a ‘Sri Lanka Sugar Industry Development

Committee’, to undertake appropriate measures to

develop domestic sugar industry by enabling both

growers and millers to enhance their income and

welfare. Further, SRI continued to develop high

tolerance and sugar yielding sugarcane varieties

for commercial cultivation. Although commercial

sugarcane cultivation in Sri Lanka commenced

several decades ago, the domestic sugar industry

encounters several structural problems. Low yields,

poor recovery rates, increased cost of production,

shortages of skilled labour, increased fertiliser

prices, lack of new technology, short crushing

seasons, inadequate irrigation facilities, and

non-availability of high quality seed material on time

affect the productivity of the domestic sugar industry.

Thus, in order to make domestic sugar industry a

viable proposition, sugarcane availability needs to

be improved with a proper cultivation plan, good

agricultural practices and the introduction of climate

resilient cane varieties that contain a higher level of

sugar. Further, immediate action is required to revive

the Kantale sugar factory, which was closed for over

25 years.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Economic

Affairs, Livestock Development, Irrigation and

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development

and the National Aquaculture Development

Authority (NAQDA) carried out a number of policy

measures to support the domestic fisheries

sector. During 2018, the Ministry continued to

discourage fishing activities using destructive

fishing methods such as bottom trawling, use of

dynamite and monofilament nets in Sri Lankan

waters aimed at improving the sustainability of

the fisheries sector. Steps were also undertaken

to increase fish production from deep sea fishing

areas and to enhance fishing activities in the

Northern and Eastern parts of the country while

strengthening the fishing fleet by installing modern

technology in fishing boats. Under the ‘Diyawara

Diriya’ loan scheme, financial support was provided

to 97 beneficiaries, incurring a cost of Rs. 236 million

during 2018. Construction and upgrading of fishery

harbours and anchorages aimed at facilitating deep

sea fishing in the Northern Province continued

during 2018 with financial support amounting to

Rs. 32 billion from the Asian Development Bank

(ADB). Meanwhile, the Ministry continued its

fisheries sector livelihood development programme

and took necessary action to prevent illegal,

unreported, and unregulated fishing activities.

The marine eco-system survey was successfully

conducted in coastal waters of Sri Lanka after

four decades with financial assistance from the

Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation

(NORAD). The findings of the survey will be used to

manage and develop marine resources. Meanwhile,

a special programme is being implemented by the

NAQDA to support the establishment of fish ponds

in estates and aquaculture in estate reservoirs

with the involvement of estate communities.

Aquaculture in estate reservoirs was carried out

in Nuwara Eliya, Kandy and Puttalam districts and

around 401,750 fish fingerlings were stocked in

estate reservoirs during 2018. In order to promote

and develop sea cucumber farming, the NAQDA

commenced the construction of a sea cucumber

hatchery in Mannar and provided expertise to

breed sea cucumber in private hatcheries. During

2018, 105,000 sea cucumber juveniles were

produced and 196 metric tons were harvested from

2

ponds and pens. The NAQDA facilitated sea weed

farming with community participation in the Northern

Province. Further, the NAQDA provided expertise

to breed mud crabs in two private hatcheries, and

89,350 crablets were produced. In order to promote

local aquaculture and attract foreign and local

investment for aquaculture, the NAQDA organised

the ‘Jalajeewi Udana’ aquaculture conference and

an investor forum during the period under review.

The Department of Animal Production

and Health (DAPH) implemented several

development programmes to support the

livestock sector. DAPH continued their activities

in line with the government policy framework for

the development of the dairy sector based on

the Livestock Sector Master Plan during 2018.

Under the Livestock (Dairy) Breeding Project,

implementation of artificial insemination service

throughout the country, strengthening and

maintenance of artificial insemination centres,

progeny testing of bull-calves for natural breeding

and pasture development were carried out to

upgrade the cattle population in order to increase

domestic milk production. The Heifer Calf Rearing

Project aimed to support farmers to feed and

manage Heifer calves and a total of 25,602 calves

have been registered under this project during

2018. Vaccination of animals and mastitis disease

control awareness programmes were conducted by

DAPH. Meanwhile, seven veterinary service offices

are being established throughout the country and

the construction of two new veterinary service

offices commenced in Pundaluoya in Nuwara Eliya

district and Haliela in Badulla district during 2018.

Strict quarantine measures and surveillance for the

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza continued during

2018. Moreover, NLDB introduced European cattle

in the coconut triangle farms in 2018 to increase

the overall milk production. The modernisation of

factories managed by MILCO (Pvt) Ltd. located

in Polonnaruwa, Digana and Ambewela was

completed in 2018, and this supported the higher

processing capacity in local dairy production.

Institutional support for livestock development

through the improvement of institutions catering to

livestock farmers, strengthening of the government

veterinary network and improvements in the service

delivery system for the livestock farming community

are expected to strengthen the livestock sector in

future.

Industry

The value added of Industry activities grew

marginally by 0.9 per cent in 2018, compared

to the growth of 4.1 per cent recorded in 2017.

This slowdown in Industry activities was mainly

attributable to the contraction in construction and

mining activities, which accounted for a significant

share of 35.1 per cent of the Industry activities. In

the meantime, manufacturing activities recorded a

modest growth in 2018. Considering the other Industry

activities, electricity related activities, sewerage,

waste treatment and disposal activities, and water

collection, treatment and supply activities continued

the positive growth trend during the year.

Mining and Quarrying

Mining and quarrying activities contracted

by 5.1 per cent in 2018, compared to the growth

of 9.1 per cent in 2017. The subdued performance

observed in construction activities adversely affected

the growth in mining and quarrying activities. Further,

the considerable decline in sand mining activities has

also contributed to this decline since land reclamation

of the Port City development project has reached its

final stage. Moreover, the mineral exports volume

index recorded a 5.9 per cent decline in 2018,

compared to the 18.8 per cent increase recorded

in 2017. The gem, diamond and jewellery exports

volume index also declined by 13.7 per cent in 2018,

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE AND INCOME

67

compared to 0.3 per cent decline recorded in 2017,

reflecting the decline in gem mining activities as

well. However, production of phosphate and mineral

sands, especially ilmenite and rutile, recorded a

growth during the year.

Manufacturing

The value added of manufacturing activities

grew by 3.0 per cent in 2018, compared to the

growth of 3.3 per cent in 2017. Manufacture of food,

beverages and tobacco products, which grew by 5.5

per cent in 2018, compared to the contraction of 0.9

per cent in 2017, benefitting from the substantial

recovery in Agriculture activities during the year,

mainly contributed to the growth in manufacturing

activities. Further, manufacturing of textiles, wearing

apparel and leather related products also grew by

3.6 per cent during the year compared to 3.8 per

cent growth recorded in 2017, largely supporting the

overall growth in manufacturing activities. However,

the negative performances in the manufacture of

coke and refined petroleum products, manufacture

of furniture, manufacture of chemical products

and basic pharmaceutical products, manufacture

of paper products, printing and reproduction of

media products, and manufacture of machinery

and equipment dampened the overall growth in

manufacturing activities. All the other sub activities

of the manufacturing category contributed positively

to the overall growth. With respect to manufacturing

activities related indicators, the Index of Industrial

Production (IIP, 2015=100) compiled by the DCS

signalled an expansion in manufacturing activities in

2018, yet at a slower pace, compared to the previous

year. Meanwhile, the Purchasing Managers' Index

(PMI) for manufacturing activities compiled by the

CBSL, on a monthly basis, also indicated an overall

expansion in manufacturing activities during the year.

Index of Industrial Production

The manufacturing sector registered a

marginal growth in 2018. As per the Index of

Industrial Production2 (IIP), the overall manufacturing

sector expanded by 0.8 per cent in 2018, compared

to the growth of 2.5 per cent in the previous year.

Several large subsectors of the IIP, including the

manufacturing of food products, beverages, wearing

apparel, rubber and plastic products, coke and refined

petroleum products and textiles registered a positive

growth during 2018. However, some subsectors of the

IIP, including the manufacturing of tobacco products,

paper and paper products, chemicals and chemical

products, non-metallic mineral products, electrical

equipment and furniture products witnessed a decline

in production during the period under review.

The manufacture of food products subsector,

which accounts for over one third of the IIP,

witnessed a marginal growth of 1.0 per cent in

2018, compared to the growth of 3.3 per cent

recorded in the previous year. The expansion in the

food products subsector was supported by higher

production of wheat flour, biscuits, canned fish,

black tea and rice. Favourable developments in the

agriculture sector and domestic demand supported

the expansion in food manufacturing activities.

Meanwhile, the beverages subsector registered a

growth of 9.1 per cent in 2018, compared to the

contraction of 11.7 per cent recorded in 2017. The

reduction of excise tax on strong and mild beer

and improved capacity utilisation during the period

under review supported the increased production.

The manufacture of wearing apparel, the

second largest subsector in the IIP, recorded

a growth of 3.9 per cent in 2018, compared to

the growth of 4.7 per cent registered in 2017.

This growth was partially supported by the

favourable impact of the reinstatement of the

GSP+ scheme in 2017. Meanwhile, manufacturing

of textiles registered a growth of 3.6 per cent

during 2018, compared to the growth of 2.3

per cent recorded in the previous year. Both the

wearing apparel and textiles subsectors together

contributed around 78 per cent of the overall growth

in the manufacturing sector in 2018. Although the

local apparel and textile industries have the potential

to expand further, the lack of economies of scale,

infrastructure constraints, and high input costs are

adversely affecting the competitive strength of the

industry. Moreover, the emergence of relatively

new textile manufacturing hubs in the region has

continuously challenged Sri Lanka’s position in a

dynamic global market. Although the reinstatement

of the GSP+ scheme has supported export demand

in the recent past, the garment industry needs

to undertake constructive measures to minimise

continued dependence on such schemes, enabling

improved resilience towards external vulnerabilities.

The manufacture of other non-metallic mineral

products subsector registered a negative growth

of 2.4 per cent during 2018, compared to the

growth of 6.5 per cent witnessed in 2017. During

2018, the manufacture of porcelain tablewear,

roofing tiles, cement and corrugated sheets declined

notably, in comparison to the previous period.

As glass is an energy intensive industry, rising

cost of energy especially on LP gas and furnace

oil have adversely affected glass production

in 2018, along with the introduction of new

taxes and levies on beverages and liquor

segment. Meanwhile, the decline in demand

in construction related raw-material can be

attributed to the moderation in construction

activities during 2018. Further, the increased

cost of production owing to higher domestic

market interest rates and increased import cost

on clinker, owing to the depreciation of the

rupee against the US dollar resulted in a lower

demand for cement from the household sector

in 2018.

Production of coke and refined petroleum

products, which contracted for three

consecutive years since 2015, recorded an

expansion in 2018. Accordingly, with increased

production of auto diesel, furnace oil and bitumen,

the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum

products subsector registered a growth of 3.4

per cent in 2018, in comparison to the contraction

of 4.8 per cent witnessed in 2017. The Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation’s (CPC) Sapugaskanda

oil refinery, which was temporarily shutdown

during June 2017, recorded an expansion in

production with the completion of the renovation

programme in early 2018. Accordingly, the

overall output from the Sapugaskanda oil

refinery was sufficient to meet around 30-35 per

cent of domestic demand, while the remaining

demand was met through imports.

Manufacturing of rubber and plastic

products continued its growth momentum

amidst low rubber prices in the international

market and the decline in domestic rubber

production. This subsector recorded a growth

of 3.7 per cent during 2018, compared to a

growth of 4.2 per cent registered in 2017. The

growth in the rubber and plastic subsector

was mainly attributed to the increased

production of tyres and sheet rubber for export.

Although Sri Lanka's solid tyre industry has a

significant growth potential, the decline in local

raw-material production has limited the

expansion of this sector.

Other subsectors in the IIP, including

the manufacture of chemicals and chemical

products and tobacco products, witnessed a

decline in 2018. Accordingly, the manufacture

of chemicals and chemical products subsector

recorded a decline of 4.1 per cent during

2018, as compared for a decline of 7.2

per cent witnessed in 2017, largely due to

decreased production of fertiliser and alkyd

resins. Meanwhile, the manufacture of basic

metals and the manufacture of fabricated

metal products increased by 6.2 per cent and

8.3 per cent, respectively, in 2018, compared

to the increase of 11.7 per cent and 16.7

per cent, respectively, in 2017. While the increase

in the production of lead and aluminium bars

contributed to the expansion in the production

of basic metals, the increase in the output

of aluminium bars, steel furniture and steel

products contributed to the increase in volume

of the manufacture of fabricated metal products.

Meanwhile, production of tobacco products

recorded a decline of 12.9 per cent in 2018,

compared to the growth of 1.2 per cent witnessed

in 2017, largely due to increased cigarette prices.

Restrictions on advertising tobacco products

and greater awareness of tobacco related health

problems also contributed to the reduction

in the demand for cigarettes. Meanwhile, the

manufacture of leather and related products

and manufacture of wood products except

furniture that together account for a share of 0.5

per cent of the IIP grew by 4.5 per cent, and 5.3

per cent, respectively, during 2018. While increased

production of finished leather contributed to the

positive movements in the former category, the

latter category grew because of the increase in

the production of railway sleepers, saw milling

and planning. Meanwhile, production volumes of

manufacture of paper and paper products (-19.9

per cent), basic pharmaceuticals products and

pharmaceutical preparations (-9.9 per cent),

electrical equipment (-18.1 per cent) and furniture

(-13.9 per cent) subsectors declined in 2018,

compared to the previous year.

While domestic demand has been driving

the manufacturing sector, going forward it is

expected that global demand would play a larger

role in the expansion of the manufacturing

sector in the country. Hence, it is important to

ensure that Sri Lankan manufacturing exports

are competitive on a sustainable basis. As global

trade environment is becoming more challenging,

with numerous high-technology areas and product

branding playing a dominant role in trade, the

country needs to support traditional sectors,

including textiles, rubber and leather industries

along with emerging sectors that are expected to

dominate global trade in future.

Industrial Policies and Institutional Support

Institutional support aimed at improving

activities in the industrial sector continued

during 2018. The Ministry of Industry and

Commerce (MIC) and the Ministry of Development

Strategies and International Trade (MODSIT) carried

out various initiatives with the aim of promoting

the manufacturing sector. The government upon

recommendation of the MIC, granted a 75 per cent

waiver on the Port and Airport Development Levy

(PAL) for the importation of high-tech machinery that

are used in manufacturing industries. Meanwhile,

the MIC is expected to expand the Achchuveli

industrial zone in the Northern Province with Indian

investment. In addition, the MIC was in the process

of preparing standard operating procedures to

support automobile manufacturing, assembly and

component manufacturing industries and to attract

foreign direct investment (FDI) into the sector.

Meanwhile, a web-portal for the Single Window

Investment Facilitation Taskforce was launched by

the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) in May

2018. The BOI also commenced development work in

Export Processing Zones (EPZs) including Bingiriya,

Mawathagama, Milleniya and Charlie Mount Estate

during 2018. A 'Skill Development Task Force' was

established by the BOI in collaboration with relevant

stakeholders, which plans to carry out measures to

improve social acceptance of factory workers, while

conducting islandwide job fairs with the Ministry

of Labour and Trade Union Relations (MLTUR).

Meanwhile, the MLTUR has granted administration

relaxation for one year to practice a five day work

week for private sector manufacturing industries

on the request of employers. It is expected that this

initiative would help to improve work life balance while

reducing additional costs incurred by employers.

Several other ministries, public institutions,

industry chambers and relevant associations

continued to implement numerous initiatives

to support the manufacturing sector and

assist in policy formulation. National Chamber

of Commerce (NCC) conducted several seminars

and workshops during the period in collaboration

with various institutions for the benefit of the

business community. Further, the NCC conducted

programmes with foreign embassies in Sri Lanka

called 'Meet the Ambassador' programme where

the business community gets an opportunity to

find out more information on trade facilities in

those countries and promote their businesses.

Meanwhile, as announced in the National Budget

2018, the Sri Lanka Export Development Board

(EDB) commenced a programme on market

access support in July 2018 that envisages to

encourage enterprises interested in expanding

their markets through modernisation, upgrading of

products and services and increase market access

with improved value added products and services

from Sri Lanka.

The National Science and Technology

Commission (NASTEC) continued to engage in

the formulation of policies and plans to support

the development of domestic manufacturing

industries. Based on policy recommendations

given in the National Research and Development

Framework (NRDF), a draft policy on basic science

research was completed in 2018. This policy aims

to give due recognition and emphasis on basic

science research in the country. Meanwhile, the

Ministry of Science, Technology and Research

(MSTR) prepared a national policy document on

genome centres and the national genome data

repository, based on policy recommendations

in the NRDF. The NASTEC is in the process of

updating the National Science and Technology

Policy, while the MSTR has given inputs to

NASTEC for formulating the National Mineral

Policy, to create a conducive environment for

foreign and local mineral based industries.

Meanwhile, several initiatives were taken by the

MSTR to support small and medium enterprises

(SMEs). Accordingly, the MSTR conducted several

technology transfer programmes through Vidatha

Resource Centres (VRC) islandwide, to accomplish

technology requirements of entrepreneurs and

potential entrepreneurs. During 2018, around

3,696 technology transfer programmes were

conducted for 140,606 beneficiaries in the fields of

electronic, computer, food technology, agriculture,

environmental, emerging technologies and other

fields. Under technology transfer programmes,

the Vidatha Technology Clinic (VTC) was initiated

to address technology issues pertaining to

entrepreneurs and to provide further assistance

for business collaboration among institutes.

Meanwhile, the MSTR in collaboration with the

Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) and the

Sri Lanka Standards Institute (SLSI) issued test

reports and quality certificates pertaining to food

products to ensure the quality of products reaching

the market. Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Institute

of Nanotechnology (SLINTEC) continued its

emphasis on research across key sectors including

agriculture, apparel, mineral resources and the

nano-medicine. The National Science Foundation

(NSF) continued to grant several scholarships

and research grants to scientists facilitating new

product development initiatives during 2018.

The ITI engaged in new product development

and process innovations while supporting

SMEs through technological enhancements.

The ITI carried out technology transfer programmes

to develop products that can be manufactured

and marketed by Sri Lankan entrepreneurs.

The ITI continued its programme on upgrading

food industries by introducing proper plant layout

designs to comply with Good Manufacturing

Practices (GMP) and ISO standards. Meanwhile,

several training programmes were conducted for

industry participants, entrepreneurs, exporters

on proper post-harvest handling techniques and

food processing techniques aimed at increasing

export earnings. The ITI also undertook several

initiatives to support industries which use

Sri Lankan raw material inputs. These initiatives

included improvement of thermal conductivity of

rubber using graphite-based nano-composite,

development of health food and herbal medicinal

products, and conversion of readily available

Sri Lankan natural quartz to solar grade silicon

for applications in electronic industries. Moreover,

the Technology and Innovation Support Centres

(TISC) at the Coordinating Secretariat for

Science, Technology and Innovation (COSTI)

supported the SME sector through measures

aimed at protecting and managing intellectual

property rights. Public Private Partnership (PPP)

programmes funded by the National Research

Council continued efforts aimed at promoting

the SME sector. The National Design Centre

and Industrial Development Board (IDB), in

collaboration with National Cleaner Production

Centre (NCPC) successfully completed the project

to facilitate SMEs to obtain ISO 14001 certification

through cleaner production practices. Meanwhile,

the IDB conducted a national programme named

'Diviyata Udanaya' aimed at developing micro and

cottage industries during 2018.

Several training and awareness

programmes were conducted by various

ministries and relevant institutions to create

a conducive environment for SMEs, while

improving competitiveness of enterprises. The

Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational

Training (MSDVT) implemented a quality

improvement system in 49 training centres with

the appointment of 54 quality ambassadors and

the establishment of a national coordinating

committee. The MSDVT continued employment

linked training programmes and enrolled 2,564

trainees under four priority sectors. The MSDVT

also undertook several measures to increase

female labour force participation while addressing

labour shortage issues mainly in the hotel,

tourism and manufacturing industries. Meanwhile,

in order to improve early childhood care and

female labour force participation, the Ministry of

Women and Child Affairs planned to establish

around 2,000 day care centres islandwide, while

increasing facilities of day care centres connected

to government institutions. Meanwhile, the

National Productivity Secretariat and the National

Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA)

conducted several training and awareness

programmes during 2018 aimed at empowering

SMEs through productivity enhancements, while

creating a conducive environment to improve

competitiveness of enterprises through effective

institutional backing.

The National Gem & Jewellery Authority

(NGJA), the institute responsible for the

development, promotion and regulation of

Sri Lankan gem and jewellery industry,

undertook several initiatives to develop

the industry during 2018. With the evolving

employment opportunities in the field of gem

cutting, jewellery designing and manufacturing, the

NGJA conducted several special industrial training

programmes for stakeholders while addressing

the labour shortage in the industry. The NGJA

is expected to conduct a National Vocational

Qualification (NVQ) level training programme for

school leavers through the granting of scholarships.

Meanwhile, in order to ensure continued supply

2

of gem stones to the market, the NGJA carried

out mobile services to provide a more effective

and efficient service to entrepreneurs who are

engaged in the mining industry.

Several policy measures were proposed

in the Budget 2019 to further strengthen the

development of the industrial sector. The

‘Enterprise Sri Lanka’ programme, which was

announced in the Budget 2018 aimed at creating an

entrepreneurial society, particularly among youth,

by providing access to capital at a concessionary

interest rate, was further strengthened in the

Budget 2019. In order to address challenges

faced by small scale entrepreneurs in providing

collateral as demanded by banks, the Budget 2019

proposed to establish a fund under the Central

Bank of Sri Lanka, to provide guarantees to the

SME sector, farmers and agro-based companies.

Amongst other proposals, an Enterprise

Innovation Programme, which will support the

development of innovative new products and

technology by Sri Lankan firms, was proposed and

will be implemented over three years. Meanwhile,

the government proposed to establish industrial

estates under IDB in Kankesanthurai, Manthai

East, Paranthan, Kondachi, Kinniya, Samanthurai

and Trincomalee. The Budget 2019 also

contained several proposals to promote export

related industries. These proposed measures

are expected to boost domestic industrial sector,

while supporting national production. Meanwhile,

the ease of doing business ranking, compiled

by the World Bank, showed an improvement in

business climate in Sri Lanka, as reflected in a

ranking of 100 in 2019, compared to the rank of

111 witnessed in 2018. However, further efforts

are necessary to implement regulatory reforms

aimed at improving the business climate and

competitiveness to make doing business easier

for entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka.

Electricity, Water and Waste Treatment

The value added of electricity, water and

waste treatment activities grew by 4.7 per

cent in 2018, compared to 3.9 per cent growth

recorded in 2017. Electricity related activities as

the main contributor to this category grew by 4.1

per cent in 2018, compared to 2.6 per cent growth

recorded in 2017. In this regard, total electricity

generation recorded a 4.0 per cent growth during

2018, compared to 3.7 per cent growth recorded

in the previous year. The growth in electricity

generation was mainly driven by significant growth

of 68.4 per cent recorded in the hydropower

generation, which was supported by favourable

weather conditions that prevailed during the year,

compared to 12.1 per cent contraction recorded

in 2017. In line with the increase in hydropower

generation in 2018, fuel oil and coal based power

generation contracted by 28.1 per cent and 6.7

per cent respectively, in 2018, compared to the

growth rates of 13.1 per cent and 1.1 per cent,

respectively, recorded in the previous year.

Meanwhile, the value added of water collection,

treatment and supply activities grew by 4.0 per

cent in 2018, compared to 4.6 per cent growth

recorded in 2017. An expansion in water supply

activities was reflected by the total number of

consumer accounts of the National Water Supply

and Drainage Board (NWS&DB), which increased

by 4.9 per cent in 2018, compared to 6.1 per cent

growth recorded in 2017. Further, the units of

water distributed by the NWS&DB increased by

4.8 per cent in 2018, compared to 3.0 per cent

growth recorded in 2017. In the meantime, value

added of sewerage, waste treatment and disposal

activities grew by 7.0 per cent during the year,

compared to 7.9 per cent growth recorded in the

previous year.

Construction

The value added of construction activities

recorded 2.1 per cent contraction in 2018,

against 4.3 per cent growth observed in

2017. The subdued performance of large scale

construction activities, especially related to

infrastructure development projects during the year,

slowed down the overall construction activities.

Reflecting a setback in construction activities,

the total cement availability contracted by 6.3 per

cent in 2018, compared to 6.3 per cent growth

recorded in 2017. In this regard, the local cement

production grew marginally by 0.8 per cent in 2018,

compared to 4.6 per cent growth in 2017, while

cement imports recorded a substantial contraction

of 9.9 per cent during the year, compared to 7.1

per cent growth during the previous year. Further,

the building material imports volume index also

declined by 3.7 per cent during the year, compared

to 6.8 per cent increase recorded in the previous

year. The growth in credit to the private sector

granted by Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs)

for construction activities also slowed down to

14.1 per cent in 2018, compared to 22.5 per cent

growth recorded in 2017. Particularly, the growth

in credit granted for personal housing construction

activities by LCBs slowed down to 13.1 per cent in

2018, from 21.4 per cent growth recorded in 2017.

Services

The value added of Services activities

expanded during 2018, registering a growth of

4.7 per cent, in comparison to 3.6 per cent growth

recorded in 2017. This growth in Services activities

was primarily driven by the robust growth in financial

services. Further, the improvement in other personal

services and the continuous expansion observed

in wholesale and retail trade activities contributed

to the growth in Services activities. Moreover,

the growth in transportation activities, real estate,

insurance, accommodation, professional services,

education, telecommunication, human health and

IT programming activities supported the growth

performance in Services activities. However, public

administration services and, programming and

broadcasting activities contracted in 2018, dragging

down the expansion in Services activities. The

expansion witnessed in Services activities was also

portrayed in PMI for Services activities, compiled

by the CBSL on a monthly basis, which denoted

an expansion in Services activities throughout the

year.

Wholesale and Retail Trade

The wholesale and retail trade activities

continued its expansion in 2018, registering a

growth of 5.0 per cent in value added terms,

compared to 3.8 per cent growth recorded in

2017. Recovery in domestic agriculture production

provided impetus to the agriculture related trade

activities. However, the continuous depreciation

of the local currency exerted some pressure on

import trade activities particularly during the latter

part of the year as reflected by trade volume

indices. Accordingly, the import volume index

increased at a slower pace of 1.8 per cent in 2018,

compared to 8.1 per cent increase recorded in

2017. Considering the sub categories of import

volume index, the consumer goods import volume

index increased by 9.6 per cent in 2018, compared

to 6.9 per cent increase recorded in 2017, which

was largely backed by the surge in vehicle imports

during the first half of the year amidst the notable

decline in food and drink imports. Meanwhile, the

intermediate goods imports volume index increased

at a slower pace of 2.3 per cent in 2018, compared

to 11.3 per cent increase in 2017. However, the

investment goods imports volume index declined

by 0.3 per cent in 2018, in comparison to 0.1

per cent decline recorded in 2017. In the meantime,

the export volume index increased only by 0.5

per cent in 2018, compared to 7.6 per cent increase

recorded in 2017, largely driven by the contraction

in agricultural exports, particularly tea and rubber

related exports, and the moderation in industrial

exports.

Transportation and Storage

The value added of transportation of goods

and passengers, including warehousing

activities grew by 2.8 per cent in 2018, in

comparison to 3.2 per cent growth recorded

in 2017. Considering the transportation related

indicators, the passenger kilometers operated by

the transportation service providers recorded a

considerable increase during the year. Accordingly,

related to the land transportation, the total passenger

kilometers operated by the Sri Lanka Transport

Board and the private sector bus operators

increased by 6.7 per cent in 2018, compared to

1.4 per cent contraction recorded in 2017. Further,

the passenger kilometers operated by the Sri

Lanka Railways also grew by 2.9 per cent in 2018,

compared to 1.1 per cent growth recorded in 2017.

Moreover, transport related new services that are

equipped with platforms that facilitates the real time

connection of customers with hiring vehicles also

have added value to the transportation services.

Related to air transportation, the total passenger

kilometers flown by Srilankan Airlines grew by

14.2 per cent in 2018, compared to 10.2 per cent

growth recorded in 2017, reflecting an expansion

in air transportation activities. Further, the freight

ton kilometers flown by Srilankan Airlines grew

by 9.0 per cent in 2018, compared to 9.8 per cent

growth recorded in 2017. Considering the water

transport activity related indicators, the container

traffic (Twenty Foot Equivalent Units - TEUs) and

cargo handled by Sri Lankan ports grew by 13.5

per cent and 11.8 per cent respectively, in 2018,

in comparison to respective growth rates of 8.3 per

cent and 8.5 per cent in 2017. In the meantime, the

value added of postal and courier activities grew

by 1.3 per cent in 2018, compared to 3.9 per cent

growth recorded in 2017.

Accommodation and Food Service Activities

The value added of accommodation, food

and beverage service activities grew by 5.5

per cent in 2018, compared to 5.0 per cent

growth recorded in 2017. The boost in tourism

related activities might have stimulated this

expansion during the year. Accordingly, tourist

arrivals recorded a substantial growth of 10.3

per cent in 2018, compared to 3.2 per cent growth

recorded in 2017. Further, reflecting the favourable

developments in the tourism industry, the earnings

from tourism increased to US dollars 4.4 billion,

recording a substantial growth of 11.6 per cent in

2018. Moreover, the pickup in private consumption

expenditure on restaurants and hotels as shown in

Gross Domestic Expenditure reflects the increased

demand for accommodation and restaurant

facilities, which might have provided impetus to

the expansion in accommodation and food service

activities during the year. However, the room

occupancy rate in graded hotel establishments

approved by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development

Authority (SLTDA) slightly decreased to 72.8

per cent in 2018, in comparison to 73.3 per cent

recorded in 2017.

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

Information and Communication

The information and communication activities

grew by 8.9 per cent in 2018, in value added

terms, compared to 9.5 per cent growth recorded

in 2017. This growth was mainly stimulated by the

considerable expansion in telecommunication

activities, which grew significantly by 9.4 per cent in

2018, compared to 12.2 per cent growth recorded in

2017. When considering the number of telephone

connections in the country, the cellular subscribers

as well as the fixed access wireline connections

continued its growing pace amidst the decline

observed in fixed access wireless connections. In

the meantime, the internet services also expanded

at a higher pace with the rising demand for data.

Accordingly, email and internet services of both

fixed and mobile broadband categories recorded

noteworthy growth during the year. Meanwhile, IT

programming consultancy and related activities

grew at a higher pace of 10.8 per cent in 2018,

compared to 4.2 per cent growth recorded in 2017.

The growing demand for IT services together with

the digitalisation initiatives introduced in several

sectors might have contributed to the expansion

in IT related services in the economy. However,

programming and broadcasting activities, and

audio video productions activities contracted by 7.0

per cent in 2018, compared to 0.9 per cent marginal

contraction recorded in 2017.

Financial, Insurance and Real Estate Activities including Ownership of Dwellings

The value added of financial, insurance and

real estate activities including ownership of

dwellings activities expanded by 8.2 per cent

in 2018, in comparison to 6.7 per cent growth

recorded in 2017. The continuous growth momentum

in financial service activities and auxiliary financial

services, which recorded a 11.8 per cent growth in

2018, compared to 9.4 per cent growth recorded in

2017, largely supported this expansion. Considering

the financial services related indicators, the gross

loans and advances in banks and non-bank financial

institutions grew by 19.6 per cent and 8.7 per cent

respectively, in 2018, compared to 16.1 per cent

and 10.2 per cent growth, respectively, recorded in

2017. Further, the deposit base of banks and non-

bank financial institutions grew by 14.8 per cent

and 4.4 per cent respectively, in 2018, compared to

respective growth rates of 17.5 per cent and 29.4

per cent recorded in 2017. In the meantime, real

estate activities including ownership of dwellings

grew by 3.8 per cent in 2018, in comparison to

4.7 per cent growth recorded in 2017. Meanwhile,

insurance, reinsurance and pension funds related

activities grew substantially by 10.0 per cent in

2018, compared to 2.1 per cent growth recorded in

2017. The premiums earned and the claims incurred

by the insurance industry recorded an increase in

2018, reflecting the favourable developments in the

insurance related activities.

Professional Services and Other Personal Service Activities

The value added of professional services

and other personal services expanded by 4.7

per cent in 2018, compared to 3.3 per cent

growth observed in 2017. The expansion in other

personal service activities was the key contributor

to the growth within the segment, supported by the

favourable contribution from professional services.

Accordingly, other personal service activities

grew at a higher rate of 4.8 per cent in 2018, in

comparison to 3.2 per cent growth recorded in 2017,

reflecting the increasing demand for such services.

In the meantime, professional, scientific, technical,

administration and support service activities

continued its positive growth, recording an increase

of 4.1 per cent in 2018, compared to 4.3 per cent

growth recorded in 2017, strengthening the growth

within the segment.

Public Administration, Defence, Education, Human Health and Social Work Activities

The public administration, defence, education,

human health and social work activities grew

marginally by 0.9 per cent in 2018, in value added

terms, compared to 1.2 per cent contraction

recorded in 2017. The slower growth within the

segment was largely attributable to the contraction

observed in public administration, defence and

compulsory social security activities, which recorded

a decline of 0.6 per cent in 2018, compared to 4.8

per cent decline recorded in 2017. Further, human

health activities, residential care and social work

activities recorded a slower growth of 2.2 per cent

in 2018, compared to 7.2 per cent growth recorded

in 2017. Meanwhile, education services grew by 3.4

per cent in 2018, in comparison to the marginal

growth of 0.5 per cent recorded in 2017.

2.5 Expenditure

Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE) which is

the combination of consumption and investment

expenditure at current prices, grew by 7.9

per cent in 2018, compared to 11.7 per cent

growth recorded in 2017. Accordingly, GDE

amounted to Rs. 15,511.8 billion in 2018. This was

supported by the growth in both consumption and

investment expenditure which grew by 8.3 per cent

and 6.8 per cent respectively, in 2018, compared to

the respective growth rates of 10.3 per cent and 15.8

per cent recorded in 2017. Considering the constant

prices, GDE grew by 3.2 per cent in 2018, compared

to 3.8 per cent growth recorded in 2017. In this

regard, investment expenditure grew by 6.6 per cent

in 2018, compared to 8.2 per cent growth recorded in

2017. However, consumption expenditure at constant

prices recorded a slow growth of 1.6 per cent in 2018,

compared to the growth of 1.8 per cent recorded in

2017. Considering the growth rates of consumption

and investment expenditure, in terms of current and

constant prices, it indicates that the price pressure

largely impacts consumption expenditure than the

investment expenditure in 2018. Meanwhile, export

of goods and services at current prices recorded a

growth of 13.2 per cent in 2018, in comparison to 14.6

per cent growth in 2017, while import of goods and

services grew by 12.4 per cent in 2018, compared

to 13.4 per cent growth recorded in 2017. Since the

import of goods and services represents a higher

value in absolute terms than export of goods and

services, net external demand at current prices

contracted by 10.3 per cent in 2018, compared to 10.1

per cent contraction recorded in 2017. At constant

prices, export of goods and services grew marginally

by 0.5 per cent in 2018, compared to 7.6 per cent

growth recorded in 2017 while import of goods and

services recorded a slower growth of 1.8 per cent in

2018, in comparison to 7.1 per cent growth recorded

in 2017. Accordingly, net external demand at constant

prices contracted at a slower pace of 3.5 per cent in

2018, compared to 6.5 per cent contraction recorded

in 2017. Reflecting the above developments, GDP

at current prices which consists of GDE adjusted

for net external demand, amounted to Rs. 14,449.9

billion in 2018 recording a growth rate of 7.7 per

cent, compared to 11.9 per cent growth in 2017. At

constant prices, GDP grew by 3.2 per cent in 2018 in

comparison to 3.4 per cent in 2017.

Consumption

The consumption expenditure at current

prices, accounted for around 78.8 per cent of

the aggregate expenditure of the economy, and

expanded by 8.3 per cent in 2018, compared

to 10.3 per cent growth recorded in 2017. The

increases observed in both private and government

consumption expenditure contributed towards this

growth. Accordingly, private consumption expenditure

grew by 7.4 per cent, accounting for 88.6 per cent of

the total consumption expenditure in 2018, compared

to 10.2 per cent growth recorded in the previous

year. Meanwhile, the government consumption

expenditure grew by 15.0 per cent in 2018, compared

to 11.4 per cent in 2017. Both collective and individual

consumption expenditure of the government, which

grew by 19.8 per cent and 4.6 per cent respectively,

in 2018 contributed to this growth.

Private Consumption Expenditure (PCE)

PCE on food and non-alcoholic beverages

at current prices grew by 6.1 per cent in 2018,

compared to 6.2 per cent growth in 2017.

Considering the import of food and beverages,

a decline of 7.5 per cent was observed in 2018,

compared to 18.4 per cent increase recorded in

2017 as per the imports rupee value index. This

was also in line with the expansion in domestic

agriculture production and the growth in food related

manufacturing activities. The increase in food

production has also resulted in a marginal decline

of 0.2 per cent the National Consumer Price Index

(NCPI, 2013 = 100) related to food and beverages

category in 2018, compared to an increase of 11.3

per cent in 2017.

PCE on clothing and footwear at current

prices grew by 4.2 per cent in 2018, against

0.4 per cent contraction in 2017. Considering

the supply side developments, the manufacture of

textiles, wearing apparel and leather related products

expanded at a slower pace in 2018, compared to

the previous year. On the other hand, the clothing

and footwear category of the NCPI increased to 4.0

per cent in 2018, from 3.2 per cent in 2017, reflecting

the increased price pressure of this category with the

slowdown in supply. However, import indices related

to the clothing and accessories in rupee value terms

decreased by 10.6 per cent in 2018, compared to 5.6

per cent increase observed in 2017, while a surge

in unit prices of imports could be seen partly due to

rupee depreciation.

Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels

related PCE at current prices increased by 7.2

per cent in 2018, compared to 6.5 per cent

recorded in 2017. Reflecting the increase in water

consumption, the units of water distributed to the

domestic sector increased at a higher rate of 4.6

per cent in 2018, compared to 3.1 per cent growth

in 2017. Meanwhile, electricity sales to the domestic

sector increased by 3.9 per cent in 2018, compared

to 4.4 per cent expansion in 2017. However, tariffs

on electricity and water remained unchanged during

the year. Meanwhile, the prices of diesel, petrol and

domestic liquid petroleum gas increased during 2018

contributing to the increase in household nominal

expenditure of this category. In the meantime, the

NCPI of housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuel

based category increased slightly to 1.3 per cent in

2018, from 0.9 per cent in 2017.

PCE on transport activities at current prices

grew by 13.2 per cent in 2018, compared to 24.0

per cent growth in 2017. The expansion in PCE

on transport activities at current prices can be partly

attributable to the upsurge in transportation costs.

Particularly, passenger transport fares on bus services

were increased in 2018, increasing the household

nominal expenditure on transport. Further, the

passenger transport fares on railways also increased

during the year. Reflecting these developments, the

NCPI related to transport activities increased to 8.4

per cent in 2018, from 5.9 per cent in 2017.

PCE on health activities at current prices

grew by 4.1 per cent in 2018, albeit at a slower

pace, compared to 7.4 per cent growth recorded

in 2017, while PCE on education activities

increased by 9.8 per cent in 2018, compared

to 8.4 per cent growth recorded in 2017. The

NCPI related to the health category decreased

to 7.6 per cent in 2018, from 9.9 per cent in

2017, reflecting the relative slowdown in price

pressure of this category, thereby, contributing to

minimize the health expenditure in nominal terms.

However, the prices of education services based

on the NCPI increased to 6.0 per cent in 2018,

from 4.1 per cent in 2017, thereby increasing the

nominal expenditure on education services. A

relatively lower shares of household consumption

expenditure on these categories could be seen

partly duee to the higher contribution from the

government in providing education and health

services for free of charge.

Government Consumption Expenditure (GCE)

The GCE, which consists of collective final

consumption expenditure (71.4 per cent of

GCE) and the individual final consumption

expenditure (28.6 per cent of GCE) of the

government, expanded at a higher rate in 2018

compared to the slow growth in the previous

year, despite the continued fiscal consolidation

efforts taken by the government. The collective

final consumption expenditure, which consists

of government expenditure on services such

as defence, general public services, social

protection, economic affairs and public order

and safety, expanded at a higher rate of 19.8

per cent in 2018, compared to 12.9 per cent growth

in 2017. This growth was mainly attributable

to the increased government expenditure on

general public services, which grew by 112.3

per cent in 2018, compared to 43.2 per cent growth

recorded in 2017. Reflecting this, the government

recurrent expenditure on salaries and wages, and

other purchases of goods and services grew by

6.5 per cent in 2018, compared to 1.4 per cent

growth recorded in 2017, as per the government

financial statistics. Meanwhile, the individual final

consumption expenditure of the government, which

consists of government expenditure on health and

education services, grew by 4.6 per cent in 2018,

compared to 8.4 per cent growth in 2017. Increase

services could be observed in the institutional

sector classification of the economy where the

government sector contribution to the health and

education services increased in 2018.

Investment

Investment expenditure at current prices

grew by 6.8 per cent in 2018, compared to

15.8 per cent growth recorded in 2017. The

moderate growth in investment expenditure was

mainly driven by the slowdown in investment on

construction activities, which is the largest category

of the investment expenditure. This slowdown was

also observed in the importation of investment

goods including building materials and in the

credit granted by the LCBs to the private sector

for construction activities. Further, investment on

machinery and equipment and weapon systems

also slowed down during the period. As reflected by

the business surveys conducted by the CBSL, the

moderate growth in investment expenditure could

be partly attributable to firms’ decisions to delay

investment on capital goods, in response to the

increase in operational costs, which arose from the

rupee depreciation. Further, the policy and political

uncertainty that prevailed in the domestic market

had also impacted on their investment decisions.

As per the government financial statistics, a

contraction could also be observed in government

investment expenditure. However, investment

on transport equipment, and information and

communication technology (ICT) equipment grew

at higher rates in 2018, compared to the previous

year, while investment in the areas of cultivated

biological resources and intellectual property also

contributed to the overall growth in investment

activities. Meanwhile, changes in inventories and

acquisition less disposals of valuables recorded a

growth of 34.5 per cent, compared to the significant

growth of 140.0 per cent observed in 2017. In

this regard, changes in inventories recorded a

substantial expansion, while acquisitions less

disposals of valuables witnessed a contraction.

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows,

including loans received by companies

registered under the Board of Investment

(BOI), amounted to US dollars 2,366.93 million

during 2018, in comparison to US dollars

1,710.3 million registered in 2017, recording a

significant growth of 38.4 per cent. The notable

increase in FDI inflows during the period under

review was largely supported by higher FDI inflows

to infrastructure related projects, which registered

a growth of 70.0 per cent in 2018, compared to the

previous year. Nearly 75 per cent of total inflows

(US dollars 1,773.7 million) during the period 2018

was on account of the infrastructure sector related

projects on port container terminals, telephone

and telecommunication networks. Inflows to

the Hambantota port (US dollars 827.6 million)

accounted for around 35 per cent of total inflows.

FDI inflows to the manufacturing sector registered

a decline of 16.1 per cent (US dollars 291.5 million)

while contributing 12.3 per cent to total inflows.

Meanwhile, FDI inflows to the services sector that

accounted for 12.7 per cent of total FDI inflows,

witnessed a decline of 5.2 per cent (US dollars

301.3 million) over the previous year.

3 The FDI figure corresponds to receipts, including loans, to companies registered with the BOI and may differ from the estimates presented in Chapter 5, mainly due to the inclu-sion of FDI inflows to non-BOI companies in the latter.

billion. Investment value of project approvals

for sectors including non-metallic mineral

products, fabricated metal products, machinery

and transport equipment recorded an increase in

2018 compared to the previous year. However,

estimated investment in approved projects in the

food, beverages and tobacco, textile, wearing

apparel and leather products, services, chemicals,

petroleum, coal and rubber and plastic products

sectors declined during the period under review,

compared to 2017. The estimated investment

value of projects contracted under Section 17

during 2018 was Rs. 221.4 billion, reflecting a

decline of 48.5 per cent over the previous period.

Estimated investment in projects that commenced

commercial operations under Sections 16 and 17

of the BOI Act amounted to Rs. 921.4 billion as

at end 2018. The cumulative realised investment

of the BOI by end 2018 was Rs. 3,301.8 billion.

year.

The available resources at current prices

were utilized for consumption, investment and

export purposes during the year. The majority

of the resources were utilized for consumption

purposes, which accounted for 60.5 per cent of the

total resource utilization in 2018, slightly decreasing

from 60.8 per cent recorded in 2017. Meanwhile, the

share of resources utilized for investment purposes

This could be partly attributable to the slower

growth in private savings which grew by 7.9

per cent in 2018, compared to 18.2 per cent

expansion observed in 2017. The increase in

government recurrent expenditure surpassed

the government revenue, resulting in an increase

in government dis-savings during the period,

dampening the growth in domestic savings.

Accordingly, domestic savings as a percentage of

GDP decreased to 21.2 per cent in 2018, compared

to 21.7 per cent in 2017.

National savings at current prices grew

at a slower pace of 4.5 per cent amounting to

Rs. 3,676.1 billion in 2018, compared to 13.9

per cent growth in 2017. This was mainly

attributable to the slowdown witnessed in the

domestic savings and the continuous contraction

in net primary income from the rest of the world, in

rupee terms, even though net current transfers from

rest of the world, in rupee terms, recorded a growth

during the year, largely supported by the increase in

workers’ remittances. Accordingly, national savings

as a percentage of GDP decreased to 25.4 per cent

in 2018, from 26.2 per cent in 2017. Meanwhile,

due to the relatively higher growth in investment

expenditure, the national savings-investment gap

broadened to 3.1 per cent of GDP in 2018, from 2.6

per cent of GDP in 2017.

2.6 Income

The aggregate of income components which

is equal to the total gross value added of the

economy at current prices grew by 8.8 per cent

in 2018, compared to 10.7 per cent growth in

2017. The Gross Operating Surplus (GOS) which

is the largest income generating component

of the economy at current prices grew by 7.8

per cent in 2018, compared to a growth of 12.6

per cent in 2017, accounting for 62.8 per cent of

GDP. This was mainly attributable to the expansion

in Net Operating Surplus (NOS), the main income

component in GOS which grew by 8.3 per cent

in 2018, compared to a growth of 12.1 per cent

in 2017. Further, the other two sub components

of GOS, consumption of fixed capital and mixed

income grew by 7.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent,

respectively, in 2018, compared to growth rates

of 17.7 per cent and 10.5 per cent, respectively,

in 2017. Meanwhile, Compensation of Employees

(CE) at current prices accounted for 28.6

per cent of GDP, recording a growth of 11.1

per cent in 2018, compared to a growth of 7.0

per cent in 2017. However, the other income

component, which is the taxes less subsidies on

production at current prices grew by 0.7 per cent in

2018 against a contraction of 7.4 per cent in 2017,

accounting for 0.3 per cent of GDP.

According to the institutional sector

classification of income generation, HH

and NPISH sector provided the highest
