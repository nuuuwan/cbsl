3.1 OverviewT

he drive towards improving economic and

social infrastructure of the country continued

during 2018 with the view of improving the

overall wellbeing of the people. The efforts in this

regard included infrastructure development projects

as well as policy measures aimed at enhancing the

provision of economic and social infrastructure.

Mainly as a result of the non-adjustment of domestic

retail prices in line with higher average international

petroleum prices and the depreciation of the rupee,

the financial performance of the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation (CPC) weakened considerably in 2018.

The cost reflective pricing mechanism for domestic

retail petroleum products that was established in

May 2018 continued thereafter, albeit with some

interruptions during the fourth quarter of the year.

The effective implementation of the petroleum

pricing formula is essential to address continued

losses accrued by this key State Owned Business

Enterprise and to protect revenue collection

as Sri Lanka’s taxes on petroleum products are

relatively low compared to its regional peers.

Meanwhile, favourable rainfall in catchment areas

supported increased contribution from low cost

hydropower generation in meeting the electricity

demand during the year. Accordingly, although the

financial position of the Ceylon Electricity Board

(CEB) remained weak, an improvement was

witnessed, compared to the previous year. The

Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL)

approved the base case Least Cost Long-Term

Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) in June

2018. However, ensuring uninterrupted power

supplies at an affordable cost depends on expediting

the implementation process for new projects to allow

a sustainable and optimal generation mix. However,

the burden of CEB losses to the tax payers needs

to be minimised by introducing a cost reflective

pricing formula, which will make users pay the

true cost while subsidising targeted low income

households. The Moragahakanda hydropower

project was commissioned during the year, while

the construction of Uma Oya and Moragolla

hydropower projects continued. Meanwhile, port

related activities witnessed a notable expansion

particularly with the port of Colombo being ranked

as the fastest growing port among the top 30

container ports of the world during the year.

Further, civil aviation activities also recorded an

expansion during the year supported by increased

tourist arrivals. Rail transportation and public road

transportation, in the meantime, recorded a modest

performance during the year highlighting the need

for better quality transportation services to attract

the general public towards public transportation

and reduce traffic congestion. Road development

projects, including the construction work of the

Outer Circular Highway (OCH) and the Central

Expressway, continued while the feasibility study

of the Ruwanpura Expressway was completed.

Meanwhile, urban development projects also

continued including the land reclamation work of the

Colombo Port City Project, which was completed in

the early part of 2019.

The government, with the support of the private

sector, continued to provide health and education

services with a view to enhancing the human

capital of the country. During 2018, the government

took measures to control the spread of both

communicable and non-communicable diseases

while implementing measures to improve the quality

of education through strengthening initiatives such

as the ‘13 years of guaranteed education’ and the

‘nearest school is the best school’ programme.

Social safety net programmes to safeguard the

welfare of the vulnerable were carried out by the

government during the year, with increased efforts

to ensure the effectiveness of these initiatives in

empowering beneficiaries and enabling better

targeting. As the limited fiscal space constrains

public spending towards enhancing economic

and social infrastructure, facilitating Public Private

Partnerships in developing economic infrastructure

while enhancing the quality assurance framework,

particularly within health, general education and

higher education sectors, are important aspects

going forward.

3.2 Economic Infrastructure Policies, Institutional Framework and Performance

Petroleum

Global crude oil (Brent) prices recorded a

notable increase during 2018 before declining

in the last two months of the year. Brent prices

showed an upward trend from mid-2017 until end

May 2018 when prices fell over the expectations

that the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting

Countries (OPEC) could wind down the output

deal, which was in place since the beginning of

2017. However, supply concerns in relation to US

trade sanctions on Iran resulted in an uptick in oil

prices from mid-August to early-October 2018.

Brent prices reached a peak of US dollars 86 on

04 October 2018, which was its highest level since

October 2014. Subsequently, from November 2018,

Brent prices followed a declining trend due to the

build-up of global inventories and record levels

of oil production from the world’s three largest

producers, i.e. the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia,

along with uncertainties about future global demand

growth, particularly with the slowdown of China

and several advanced economies. Accordingly,

the average crude oil (Brent) price that stood at US

dollars 80.93 per barrel in October 2018 declined

to US dollars 58.16 per barrel in December 2018.

However, on average, Brent price was 31 per cent

higher at US dollars 71.76 per barrel in 2018, compared

to US dollars 54.76 in 2017.

The average price of crude oil imports of the

CPC moved in line with global crude oil prices.

Consequently, the average price of crude oil imported

by the CPC increased by 31.9 per cent to US dollars

76.25 per barrel in 2018 from the average price of

US dollars 57.79 per barrel in the preceding year.

Meanwhile, the average import price of refined

petroleum products by the CPC increased by

25.3 per cent to US dollars 650.2 per MT in 2018,

from US dollars 518.9 per MT in 2017.

Domestic retail prices of petroleum products

were revised periodically during 2018, with

the implementation of a cost reflective pricing

formula in May 2018. Accordingly, retail prices for

petrol, diesel and kerosene products of the CPC

were revised nine times during the year commencing

May 2018. As a result, the price of petrol (92 octane)

was at Rs. 125 per litre at end 2018, compared to

Rs. 117 per litre at end 2017, while the price of

auto diesel was at Rs. 101 per litre at end 2018,

compared to Rs. 95 per litre at end 2017. Although

kerosene prices were initially increased to Rs. 101

per litre, considering the excessive price pressure

on economically vulnerable segments of the

population and the fisheries sector, the government

reduced the price of kerosene to Rs. 70 per litre with

effect from June 2018, and maintained it at that level

thereafter. Meanwhile, furnace oil prices also increased to

Rs. 92 per litre at end 2018, compared to Rs. 80 per litre

at end 2017.

Petroleum products sales decreased in 2018

with the decline in demand from the power

generation sector. During the year, total local

sales of petrol grew by 6.9 per cent in comparison

to the previous year. The sharp increase in the

import of motor vehicles was a considerable factor.

Meanwhile, total domestic sales of diesel declined

by 8.3 per cent due to lower fuel oil based power

generation as a result of increased hydropower

generation. Hence, in 2018, petroleum sales to the

power generation sector was 34.0 per cent lower

than the previous year. Kerosene sales showed a

significant increase of 30.4 per cent during 2018

in comparison to the preceding year. During 2018,

total petroleum sales to the transportation and

aviation sectors grew by 1.8 per cent and 9.3

per cent, respectively.

Financial performance of the CPC deteriorated

substantially during 2018, amidst rising

global oil prices, depreciation of the

rupee against the US dollar and the non-

adjustment in domestic retail petroleum

prices until May 2018. As per the unaudited

provisional financial statements, the CPC

reported an operational loss of Rs. 104 billion

in 2018, compared to a profit of Rs. 3.4 billion

in 2017. Depreciation of the rupee against the

US dollar resulted in a loss of Rs. 82.7 billion to

the CPC during 2018, while lower demand from

the power generation sector also contributed to

the reduction in revenue of the CPC. Although

there was a notable increase of rupee deposits

of the CPC with state banks, from Rs. 5.0 billion

at end 2017 to Rs. 67.9 billion at end 2018, total

gross liabilities to the banking sector increased

by Rs. 116.2 billion to Rs. 293.2 billion during

the year largely reflecting the impact of the US

dollar denominated borrowings by the CPC.

Further, the CPC’s outstanding trade receivables from government entities decreased by Rs. 10.4 billion to Rs. 81.7 billion in 2018, compared to 2017. As at end 2018, the CEB and SriLankan

Airlines (SLA) accounted for 58.3 per cent

and 31.3 per cent,respectively, of total trade

receivables of the CPC.

Large losses incurred by the CPC highlight

the need to strengthen its financial viability on

a sustainable basis. Accumulated financial losses

of the CPC continued to burden the fiscal situation

of the government, while higher borrowings by

the CPC to cover its financial deficit affected the

banking sector as well. The sharp depreciation of

the rupee against the US dollar also generated

significant losses to the CPC on top of its legacy

debt. Hence, measures are needed to ensure the

CPC’s financial viability while taking measures

to reduce its vulnerability to exchange rate

fluctuations. Although demand for kerosene is

expected to decline with more households being

connected to the electricity grid, consumption of

kerosene has continued to increase since 2015.

Kerosene is sold at a subsidised price with the

aim of supporting low-income households and

the fisheries sector but misuse of kerosene by

unintended subsidy beneficiaries also contributed

to the erosion of the financial performance of the

CPC. Therefore, conversion of the kerosene price

subsidy to a targeted cash subsidy could partly

reduce the financial burden of the CPC. Moreover,

with the support of private sector investments,

Sri Lanka’s oil refinery capacity needs to be

improved to enhance the domestic supply of

refined petroleum products. Hence, up scaling

of the capacity of the Sapugaskanda refinery and

discharge lines as well as investment in refining

of low grade crude oil to high value petroleum

products are needed to strengthen energy security

of the country, limit external price shocks and

reduce losses of the CPC. Further, measures such

as effective adjustment of domestic petroleum prices

and enhancing renewable electricity generation to

decrease the reliance on petroleum products would

also support the financial performance of the CPC.

The Petroleum Resources Development

Secretariat (PRDS) continued to support oil and

gas exploration activities during 2018. In May

2018, the government entered into a contractual

Umbrella Multi-Client Agreement with a subsidiary

of a global oil field service, to enhance the off-shore

exploration data repository capacity of the country.

The survey operations under the agreement were

completed in 2018 with the detailed data acquisition

of 5,000 line-km, 250 line-km, 500 line-km and

2,500 line-km in JS 05 and JS 06, Cauvery Basin,

Lanka Basin and Mannar Basin blocks. In 2018, the

Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to float a bid

round to find the most suitable entity for commercial

production of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in Block

M2 of the Mannar basin. Accordingly, the bid round

was floated in January 2019 and awarding of the

contract to the successful bidder is expected in

August 2019.

Electricity

Electricity generation continued to expand

in 2018, supported by a significant growth

in hydropower generation. Total electricity

generation grew by 4 per cent to 15,255 GWh,

following the growth of 3.7 per cent in 2017. The

share of hydropower generation, excluding mini

hydropower, recorded an increase of 68.4 per cent

to 5,149 GWh in 2018, in comparison to the

previous year, reflecting the higher level of rainfall

in catchment areas during the year. With increased

hydropower generation, the total fuel oil-based

power generation declined by 28.1 per cent to

3,626 GWh, while coal power generation decreased

by 6.7 per cent to 4,764 GWh during 2018. The coal

power generation declined mainly due to failures

at the Norochcholai coal power plant. Meanwhile,

power generation through Non-Conventional

Renewable Energy (NCRE) sources also increased

by 17.3 per cent to 1,716 GWh owing to the rise

in mini hydropower generation by 27.3 per cent to 1,203.4 GWh and solar power generation by 15.3 per cent to 98.2 GWh in 2018, in comparison to the corresponding period of 2017. Accordingly, of the total power generation, the share of hydro, fuel oil, coal and NCRE power generation was 34 per cent, 24 per cent, 31 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively, during 2018. The share of power generated by the CEB increased to 77.4 per cent in 2018, compared to 72.9 per cent in 2017, while the remainder was purchased from Independent Power Producers (IPPs). The overall transmission and distribution loss as a percentage of total power

generation reduced to 7.6 per cent in 2018 from

8.5 per cent in the previous year. During 2018,

total electricity sales increased by 5.0 per cent to

14,100 GWh, compared to 13,430 GWh recorded

in 2017. Electricity sales in the ‘domestic’ and

'religious' category increased by 3.9 per cent with

the rise in the number of consumers by 2.6 per cent

in 2018, in comparison to 2017. Meanwhile, sales

to ‘industry’ and ‘general purpose’ categories,

which account for 30.5 per cent and 20.8 per cent

of sales, respectively, also registered increases

of 6.4 per cent and 5.7 per cent, respectively, in

2018.

The financial performance of the CEB

remained weak in 2018 as well. Although

hydropower generation improved considerably

during 2018, it was not sufficient to offset the losses

incurred on account of high cost thermal power

generation. According to the unaudited provisional

financial statements, the CEB recorded a loss before

tax of Rs. 28.9 billion in 2018, in comparison to

Rs. 46.0 billion loss in 2017. The low fuel oil

requirement for power generation, driven by

increased hydropower availability, reduced the

CEB’s cost on fuel significantly by 28.2 per cent, to

Rs. 41.6 billion in 2018. Hence, the overall average

cost of electricity at the selling point reduced

to Rs. 19.13 per kWh in 2018 in comparison to

Rs. 20.06 per kWh in 2017, while the overall

average tariff as at end December 2018 was

Rs. 16.30 per kWh, compared to Rs. 16.49 per

kWh the previous year. Although the average

cost of electricity at the selling point fell during the

year, it remained above the overall average tariff,

indicating the need for cost reflective pricing in

the sector. As at end 2018, the average electricity

tariffs charged by the CEB from domestic, general

purpose, government, industrial and hotel sectors

were Rs. 13.60, Rs. 23.78, Rs. 18.24, Rs. 14.72

and Rs. 17.61 per kWh, respectively. Meanwhile,

short-term liabilities of the CEB, primarily to the

banking sector, the CPC and IPPs, increased to

Rs. 141.1 billion by end 2018, from Rs. 138.0 billion

at end 2017. Long-term liabilities of the CEB, which

are mainly to the banking sector, increased to

Rs. 392.2 billion at end 2018 from Rs. 319.6 billion

at the end of 2017. The weak financial position of

the CEB and the considerable strain it casts on the

balance sheet of the state banks highlight the need

for the implementation of plans for the expansion

of power generation through less costly sources

without delay in addition to the urgent need to

introduce a cost-reflective pricing mechanism for

electricity.

The PUCSL granted conditional approval

for the base case LCLTGEP for 2018 - 2037

submitted by the CEB in June 2018, subject

to the accommodation of Cabinet-approved

‘Government to Government’ LNG power

plants and the latest government policy on the

electricity generation mix. Accordingly, as per

the Cabinet approval, the national policy on

the energy mix to be met by 2030 consists of

30 per cent LNG or indigenously available natural

gas, 30 per cent high-efficient coal, 25 per cent

large hydro, 15 per cent from both furnace oil, which

is a by-product from the refineries in the country,

and non-conventional renewable energy sources.

The government policy on the electricity generation

mix emphasised environmental conservation and

the need to develop non-conventional renewable

energy sources to maximum feasible levels

while ensuring the country’s energy security

and diversification of the generation mix with

the minimum possible generation cost. Further,

the government proposed to adopt improved

technologies to develop non-renewable energy

sources such as high efficient super critical coal

power technologies, LNG, nuclear power and

indigenously available natural gas. However,

consistency in policy decisions on the optimal

energy mix and the generation expansion plan is

essential to prevent possible adverse implications

arising from insufficient and costly power generation.

Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the economic

costs of different energy sources to determine the

optimal energy mix through a collaborative effort

of the PUCSL, the CEB, the Ministry of Power

and Renewable Energy and industry experts.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Power and Renewable

Energy has taken steps to ensure the availability

of LNG for the forthcoming LNG plants, including

storage and terminal facilities. Accordingly, the

Ministry is in the process of preparing LNG supply

and infrastructure development tenders for the

procurement of approximately 1,000 MW capacity

power plants. Although offshore explorations

have confirmed the existence of economically

viable natural gas deposits in the Mannar basin,

the discovery of natural gas resources is still at

an early stage. The CEB plans to introduce such

indigenously available natural gas as a fuel option

to these plants in the period ahead.

The PUCSL took several steps during 2018

to regulate the electricity market and enhance

consumer safety. Subsequent to a public consultation,

the PUCSL with other stakeholder agencies

established a framework for licensing electricians

with the aim of safeguarding the public as well as

increasing the demand for qualified electricians

through formal recognition. During the period under

review, guidelines were prepared for the installation

of rooftop solar power systems, which specify

current standards, best practices and information for

the installation of solar power systems on existing

structures. Further, the PUCSL introduced guidelines

for the connection and supply of electricity and new

updates to the standard tariff agreements between

suppliers and consumers in 2018. In addition, the

PUCSL continued public consultation throughout

the year, seeking public and stakeholder views and

suggestions on various policy measures to be taken

on electricity, water and petroleum sectors.

With the aim of catering to the growing energy

demand while reducing the cost of electricity

generation in the country, construction work of

several large scale hydropower projects was in

progress during the year. The Moragahakanda

hydropower project was commissioned during

2018 with a total capacity of 25 MW. Construction

work of the Uma Oya hydropower project and

Moragolla hydropower project was in progress

during 2018, and these power plants are expected

to contribute an installed capacity of 120 MW and

30.2 MW, respectively, to the national grid by

end 2019 and end 2022, respectively. Further,

Broadlands hydropower project with a capacity

of 35 MW is expected to be commissioned by

end 2019. In addition, the 15 MW Thalpitigala

hydropower plant will be completed by 2020, while

the 20 MW of Seethawaka hydropower plant will

be added to the national grid by end 2019.

Several NCRE generation expansion projects

were in progress during 2018. The ‘Soorya Bala

Sangramaya’, which was introduced to convert

one million households to solar energy generation

roof top plants, continued in 2018. Accordingly,

60.7 MW was connected to the national grid in

2018 and a further 70 MW is expected to be added

to the grid by the end of 2019. The ‘Rivi Bala Savi’

concessionary loan scheme to promote rooftop

solar plants also continued during the year. Further,

required approvals such as development permits

and energy permits for the Mannar Wind Power

Project with an expected capacity of 100 MW,

have been secured during 2018.

During 2018, numerous measures were

taken in the electricity sector to improve energy

efficiency and conservation. With the intention

of saving energy, a LED lamp distribution scheme

named ‘Shakthi’ has been developed by the Sri

Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) during

the year. The SLSEA plans to distribute 10 million

LED lamps among 3.9 million households, which

will reduce peak demand by 304 MW, saving 432

GWh on an annual basis. Under this scheme,

it is expected to carry out a bulk purchase of

LED lamps, which are more efficient than both

Incandescent Filament Lamps (IFL) and Compact

Florescent Lamps (CFL), and supply at a price less

than one third of the market price to be recovered

on a 24 months installment basis without interest.

In addition, the SLSEA plans to establish a solar

power park in Siyambalanduwa in the Moneragala

district and a solar-wind hybrid park in Pooneryn.

Road Development

The rehabilitation of existing roads and

construction of new roads continued amidst

tight fiscal conditions in 2018, in order to

improve the road network to support economic

activity. Total expenditure incurred by the Road

Development Authority (RDA) on road development

projects amounted to Rs. 160.4 billion in 2018,

which is a decrease of 16.9 per cent compared to

the previous year. This included expenditure of

Rs. 60.5 billion on expressway development,

Rs. 70.0 billion on highway development and

Rs. 13.1 billion on construction of bridges and

flyovers. As at end 2018, the RDA maintained a

total length of 12,389.9 km of road, which included

national highways and expressways, together with

4,662 bridges.

Projects aimed at improving the road

network progressed during 2018. The widening

and improvement of 64.3 km length of road and

reconstruction of 13 bridges in the Central and

Uva Provinces commenced in 2018, with financial

assistance amounting to Rs. 14.0 billion from

the Exim Bank of China. Meanwhile, 15 contract

packages for the rehabilitation, improvement

and maintenance of 249 rural roads in the Uva

Province were awarded in July 2018 under the

i-Road-II project. Rehabilitation and improvement

work of the Rambewa to Medawachchiya section

of the Kandy-Jaffna road under the Northern

Road Connectivity Project recorded 99.0 per

cent progress at end 2018. Further, under the

first phase of the Priority Roads Project-3, work

related to the rehabilitation of 30.1 km length of

road in four highways commenced during 2018.

Meanwhile, rehabilitation and improvement of the

Bibile-Chenkaladi section of the Badulla-Chenkaladi

road commenced in July 2018 while rehabilitation

of the Badulla-Bibile section was in progress

during the year. Further, the feasibility study for

the extension of the Marine Drive from Dehiwala

to Panadura and land acquisition activities for the

extension of the Baseline road from Kirulapone to

the Colombo-Horana road were also in progress

during 2018. The government incurred a cost

of Rs. 4.4 billion to carry out routine and urgent

improvement work of the national roads under

the maintenance programme for the year 2018. In

addition, the construction of the new bridge over the

Kelani River at Peliyagoda and the feasibility study

for the construction of flyovers at Alawwa, Slave

Island and Muththettugala railway level crossings

progressed during 2018. Meanwhile, a road length

of 167.3 km was rehabilitated during 2018 under

the 'Maga Neguma' programme.

Work related to the development and

expansion of the national expressway network

continued in 2018. The consultancy services and

civil work of the Southern Expressway extension

project from Matara to Hambantota, which included

an expressway link to Mattala, was in progress during

2018. Accordingly, as at end 2018, the progress

of the civil works of the Southern Expressway

extension project that comprised four sections, i.e.,

section 1(Matara to Beliatta), section 2 (Beliatta to

Wetiya), section 3 (Wetiya to Andarawewa) and

section 4 (Mattala to Hambantota via Andarawewa)

were at 86.7 per cent, 61.2 per cent, 88.8 per cent

and 86.1 per cent, level of completion, respectively.

Further, construction work of the first two sections of

the Central Expressway extending from Kadawatha

to Dambulla, with its Meerigama-Ambepussa and

Pothuhera-Galagedara links, continued during

2018. Also, construction work of Phase III of the

OCH from Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya with a link

to the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway continued

during 2018. Under the expressway connectivity

improvement plan, work related to the rehabilitation

and improvement of the Kottawa-Pinhena junction

section of the Kottawa-Thalagala road widening

project was in progress during 2018.

Several major road development projects are

planned to be implemented in the medium term.

The feasibility study of the proposed 74 km-long

Ruwanpura expressway, which will link the Southern

expressway from Kahathuduwa and extend up

to Pelmadulla, was completed during 2018. The

total estimated construction cost for the project is

Rs. 213 billion and land acquisition activities were

in progress during 2018. The RDA has undertaken

several measures to reduce traffic congestion and

improve road safety in several road sections and

junctions within townships and suburbs during the

year. Accordingly, planning, designing and bid

preparation for the establishment of an advanced

traffic management system in the Colombo

metropolitan region continued. Consultancy

services for the detailed design of the Port Access

Elevated Highway project were completed while

consultancy services for financial and transaction

advisories for the Peliyagoda-Rajagiriya section

were in progress. Further, the RDA has proposed to

construct bypass roads in Ratnapura, Warakapola,

Kurunegala and Hikkaduwa and plans to conduct

a feasibility study in 2019 to construct a bypass

road in Kochchikade as well. Though the

government has already invested considerably

in developing the road network, which included

a significant portion of funding coming from debt

related sources, to improve regional connectivity,

this investment drive has not been able to fully

realise envisaged regional economic expansion.

This highlights the need to prioritise development

projects in those areas to get the maximum benefit

of these investments.

Road Passenger Transportation

During 2018, road passenger transportation

services provided by the private sector increased

while services provided by the public sector

recorded a decline. The total operated kilometrage

of buses of the Sri Lanka Transport Board

(SLTB) decreased marginally by 0.4 per cent to

446.3 million km, while total passenger kilometrage

also declined by 1.7 per cent to 15.5 billion km. The total

number of buses owned by SLTB declined to 6,955 in

2018 from 7,305 in 2017, while the average number

of buses operated also declined to 5,227 in 2018

from 5,266 in 2017. This reduction was due to the

disposal of old buses, which could not be refurbished

economically amidst the slower addition to the bus

fleet. Meanwhile, the number of buses owned by the

private sector increased marginally by 0.2 per cent

to 20,030 while the operated average bus fleet also

increased by 6 per cent to 19,055 in 2018. The total

operated kilometrage of private buses increased by

10.1 per cent to 1.1 billion km, while passenger

kilometrage improved by 9.1 per cent to 55.5 billion km

during the period under review.

Meanwhile, following the domestic fuel price

revisions, bus fares were also revised several

times during 2018. Accordingly, the Cabinet of

Ministers on 22 May 2018 granted approval to

increase bus fares by 12.5 per cent and to increase

the minimum fare of Rs. 10 to Rs. 12. However,

considering diesel price fluctuations in the domestic

market, bus fares were further increased by

4 per cent with effect from 21 September 2018,

while bus fares were reduced by 2 per cent and

4 per cent with effect from 9 November 2018 and

26 December 2018, respectively. Meanwhile, the

minimum bus fare was kept unchanged at the level

of Rs. 12.

Despite the reduction in operations, the

financial performance of the SLTB improved

during 2018. As per provisional unaudited

financial statements, total revenue of the SLTB

increased by 4.6 per cent to Rs. 44.1 billion in

2018 with the increase in revenue from passenger

fares by 7.6 per cent in 2018 in comparison

to the previous year. In spite of the growth of

4.6 per cent in operating expenditure to Rs. 41.9

billion, the operational profit also grew by 4.2 per

cent to Rs. 2.2 billion in 2018, compared to the

previous year. Meanwhile, the SLTB carried out

routine maintenance activities of the bus fleet during

2018 under the annual rehabilitation project by

utilising Rs. 1,397 million. The SLTB commenced

a project to establish nine vehicle emission testing

centres in the nine provinces, and preliminary

civil engineering work progressed during 2018.

Moreover, 23 SLTB depots obtained Environmental

Protection Licenses during the year, while another

30 depots engaged in preliminary civil activities

to acquire the licenses. Further, the Cabinet

appointed permanent procuring committee for the

procurement of electric buses is expected to obtain

approval from the Cabinet to purchase electric

buses. Meanwhile, the SLTB deployed 38 and 78

luxury buses in the Katunayake expressway and

the Southern expressway, respectively, to provide

high quality efficient public transport facilities.

The National Transport Commission

(NTC) continued to take action to improve the

efficiency of the bus service to underserved

areas in 2018. The government allocated Rs. 552

million to the ‘Sisu Seriya’ service during 2018,

which provides safer, cost effective and reliable

transport facilities to school children. During the

year, 56 new buses have been added to the ‘Sisu

Seriya’’ bus fleet, which operated with 1,418 buses.

Meanwhile, 43 new buses were launched in 2018

under the ‘Nisi Seriya’ service, implemented to

3

serve late night and early morning passengers. The

‘Gemi Seriya’ programme continued to improve

accessibility of people living in rural areas and the

NTC plans to initiate 10 new services under this

project. Several measures were taken by the NTC

to optimise productivity and management of road

passenger transportation in 2018. The NTC obtained

the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers in September

2018, for the implementation of the proposed Unified

Transport Card Solution (UTCS), which is expected

to provide passengers with a convenient transport

payment card that can be used for multiple transport

modes.

The registration of new motor vehicles

increased by 6.5 per cent to 480,799 during

2018 as against a contraction of 8.4 per cent

observed in the previous year. The increase in

vehicle registration was largely witnessed in motor

cars, which showed a 106.2 per cent growth in 2018.

This increase was mainly driven by the favourable

duty structure applicable to small engine capacity

vehicles through the 2018 Budget. However, the

government and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka took

a number of measures to reduce the importation

of motor vehicles for personal use during 2018 to

address the rising trade deficit. Consequently,

the growth in registration of new motor vehicles

showed a declining trend towards the end of the

year. Meanwhile, new registration of three wheelers,

motor cycles, buses, goods transport vehicles and

land vehicles recorded contractions of 14.8 per cent,

1.3 per cent, 11.2 per cent, 18.0 per cent, and

21.2 per cent, respectively, in 2018. Although the

economic development strategy of the country

identifies the need for an efficient public transportation

system, the lack of such a system and the favourable

changes to the tax structure of small motor vehicles

from the 2018 Budget led to an increase in motor

vehicle imports draining a considerable amount of

foreign exchange from the country.

Rail Transportation

The Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) registered a

modest growth in passenger transportation

activities in 2018, while goods transportation

activities recorded a decline. During the

year, with the addition of new and rehabilitated

rolling stock to the service, rail passenger

kilometrage increased by 2.9 per cent to 7.7

billion passenger km, in comparison to 7.5 billion

passenger km recorded in 2017. However, the

goods kilometrage decreased by 17.3 per cent to

119.8 million MT km in 2018, compared to 144.8

million MT km in 2017, reflecting the inefficiencies

arising from trade union action, train cancellations

and the shortage of locomotives for goods

transportation activities.

Construction, improvement and rehabilitation

of the railway infrastructure continued during

2018. The SLR commenced initial work on the

rehabilitation of the railway line from Maho to

Omanthai with a signal system in the Northern

railway line and double tracking of the railway

line from Polgahawela to Kurunegala during

the year. Further, double tracking of the Kandy

rail track from Peradeniya to Kadugannawa

continued in 2018. The Colombo Suburban Railway

Development Project, which was jointly launched

by the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation and

the SLR, continued with financial assistance from

the Asian Development Bank (ADB) during the

year. Under this project, preparation of detailed

plans for the electrification of existing railway lines,

construction of parallel railroads and renovation of

associated railway stations progressed in 2018.

Construction work of the 115 km long railway line

from Matara to Katharagama continued during the

year. Meanwhile, 92.2 per cent of the construction

work of the first stage of this project from Matara to

Beliatta was completed by end 2018. This project

will facilitate economic activities in Colombo, Galle,

Matara, Hambantota and Moneragala districts by

increasing connectivity between these regions.

The SLR continued its operations aimed

at improving its physical infrastructure to

increase the punctuality and reliability of the

railway service during the year. Accordingly,

the SLR took steps to strengthen the rolling

stock through the importation of new units under

the Indian line of credit. A new locomotive and a

Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) were purchased under

this line of credit and the procurement process

is expected to continue in 2019 as well. Further,

under the financial assistance of the government,

the SLR commenced the procurement process

to purchase Diesel Electric Locomotives and 9

DMUs to be used on the upcountry railway line.

Meanwhile, the project for the installation of 200

new protected level crossing systems under

Hungarian financial assistance commenced in

2018, under which 85 systems were established

while 48 existing level crossing systems were

repaired. Meanwhile, the signalling system of

the Kaluthara South-Payagala South railway line

was improved while the signalling system of the

Seeduwa-Katunayaka railway line was completed

in 2018. In addition, the SLR carried out routine

repair and rehabilitation work on the existing

rolling stock during the year.

SLR continued to record a weak financial

performance in 2018 as well. Total revenue of the

SLR increased by 14.4 per cent to Rs. 7.4 billion,

mainly due to the upward revision of passenger

fares in October 2018. However, total expenditure

increased by 9.9 per cent to Rs. 29.6 billion in

2018, owing to the increase in capital expenditure

with respect to payments made for the purchase

of rolling stock, which is to be delivered in 2019.

Services of the SLR were occasionally disrupted

this year due to trade union action. This led to

hardship for commuters while impacting adversely

on overall economic activities of the country.

Hence, issues related to the railway sector should

be addressed in a proactive manner to provide

solutions acceptable to all stakeholders to ensure

uninterrupted services to the general public as

well as the increasing number of tourists who

have a preference for rail transportation. Further,

the efficiency of the overall rail transport system,

which is deteriorating due to out-dated technology,

inadequate service, lack of skilled labour and poor

administration, should be addressed through public

as well as private investment aimed at improving

service delivery.

Civil Aviation

The civil aviation sector continued its

positive growth momentum during 2018 largely

supported by higher passenger movements

and cargo handling activities. Reflecting

increased tourist arrivals, passenger movements

registered a growth of 9.9 per cent to 10.8 million,

while cargo handling registered a marginal growth

of 0.8 per cent to 268,496 metric tons in 2018,

facilitated by the operation of thirty five international

airlines. The total number of aircraft movements

through the Bandaranaike International Airport

(BIA) witnessed an increase of 9.7 per cent to

74,512 in 2018. Although closure of the BIA runway

for renovation improved operations at the Mattala

Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) in 2017, both

passenger movements and cargo handling at the

MRIA reverted to low levels during 2018. In terms of

aircraft movements, the MRIA registered a significant

decline of 50.0 per cent to 709 in 2018. Further,

total passenger movements and cargo handling at

the MRIA in 2018 was 2,258 and 179 metric tons,

respectively, registering a decline of 86 per cent

and 63 per cent, respectively, in comparison to the

previous year. Meanwhile, domestic passenger

movements facilitated by seven domestic airlines

registered an increase of 24.9 per cent to 30,725 in

2018, in comparison to 24,597 in the previous year.

The financial performance of SLA remained

weak in 2018 as well. As per the provisional financial

statements, SLA recorded an operating loss of

Rs. 18.6 billion in 2018, in comparison to a loss of

Rs. 11.9 billion recorded in 2017. This was

the outcome of an increase in total revenue by

16.7 per cent to Rs. 172.7 billion in 2018, compared

to a 19.6 per cent increase in operating expenditure to

Rs. 191.2 billion. Attempts at enhancing operational

efficiency through improvements in fuel efficiency,

changes in flight schedules and aircraft fleet have

also been carried out during 2018. A ten-member

expert committee was appointed in January 2019,

which has already made recommendations on key

areas for a restructuring strategy.

Construction work related to both domestic

and international aviation development projects

progressed during 2018. Construction work relating

to a remote apron and taxiways under the second

phase of the BIA project continued during the year,

and by end 2018, progress was around 17 per cent.

The second phase of the BIA project is expected to

be completed by November 2019. The government

also gave priority to developing domestic airports

including Ratmalana, Hingurakgoda and Palaly

in order to enhance local aviation networks.

Meanwhile, civil aviation activities at the Batticaloa

Domestic Airport (BDA) recommenced in March

2018. By end 2018, the BDA handled 1,176 aircraft

while facilitating 3,854 passenger movements and

47.8 metric tons of cargo handling. Further, the

approval of the Cabinet of Ministers was granted for

the Master Plan prepared by the Airport and Aviation

Services Sri Lanka Limited (AASL) to develop the

Ratmalana Airport to exploit business opportunities

in civil aviation. Meanwhile, an Environmental

Impact Assessment to establish a domestic airport

in Bandarawela was in progress during 2018.

The government continued to implement effective

policy measures aimed at enhancing activities

pertaining to the aviation industry in Sri Lanka.

Accordingly, during 2018, the government took

steps to formulate a civil aviation policy that would

provide a strong legal framework for all activities of

the aviation industry in the country.

Port Services

Port sector activities continued to improve

in 2018 supported by operations at all container

terminals of the Colombo port as well as the

improved performance of the Hambantota port.

Accordingly, the Colombo port handled 7.0 million

twenty-foot equivalent container units (TEUs) in

the year 2018, which was a 13.5 per cent growth

from the previous year. The performance of the

Colombo port in terms of transshipment and cargo

handling, recorded growth rates of 18.2 per cent and

12.5 per cent, respectively, in 2018 compared

to the previous year. Container handling at the

Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT)

and South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT)

increased by 12.0 per cent and 14.2 per cent,

respectively, in 2018. Meanwhile, container

handling at the Jaye Container Terminal (JCT) and

Unity Container Terminal (UCT), which are fully

owned by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA),

grew by 14.6 per cent during 2018. Accordingly,

the CICT, SLPA and SAGT accounted for

38.0 per cent, 32.7 per cent and 29.3 per cent,

respectively, of total container handling within

the Colombo port during 2018. Meanwhile,

transshipment container handling at the CICT,

SLPA and SAGT increased by 15.4 per cent,

21.8 per cent and 17.6 per cent, respectively, in

2018. Total cargo handling at the SLPA managed

JCT and UCT reported a growth of 12.8 per cent,

while the privately managed SAGT and CICT

terminals recorded a growth of 14.5 per cent

and 11.5 per cent, respectively, during 2018.

Meanwhile, the port of Colombo has been ranked

as the world’s fastest growing port among the top

30 container ports in the world by Alphaliner Global

Port rankings during 2018. The performance of the

Hambantota port improved after the concession

agreement with the China Merchants Port Holdings

Company (CMPort) to develop and operate the port.

During 2018, cargo discharging, cargo loading and

cargo handling registered a significant growth of

121.1 per cent, 160.1 per cent and 131.6 per cent,

respectively, compared to the previous year.

Meanwhile, a growth of 115.9 per cent was recorded

in total vehicle handling at the Hambantota port during

2018 compared to the previous year.

Development projects were carried out at the

Colombo port as well as Galle, Kankesanthurai,

Oluvil and Trincomalee ports to enhance port

activities during 2018. The development of the

East Container Terminal (ECT) continued under the

Colombo South Port project during 2018. The SLPA

developed 440 metres of the quay wall, adjacent

yard area, and connected facilities of the ECT. A

National Port Master Plan, which includes plans

for the development of Colombo and Trincomalee

ports, is being prepared with technical assistance

from international consultants. Moreover, in order

to accommodate the increasing demand for bulk

cargo handling at the port of Trincomalee, it has

been decided to expand the existing Ashraf Jetty

by 50 metres and construct another 110 metre

long quay wall at a depth of 14 metres in alignment

with the existing jetty. In addition, the Danish

International Development Agency carried out an

engineering study to find a suitable solution for

the prevailing siltation issue at the Oluvil harbour.

Preliminary procedures related to the rehabilitation

of the Kankesanthurai port were taken by the SLPA

during 2018 and the construction work is expected

to commence by end 2020. Further, the Request

for Proposals (RFP) for the Yacht Marina project at

the port of Galle was issued during 2018 and the

evaluation of RFPs was in progress.

Financial profitability of the SLPA declined

in 2018 amidst the increasing port activities. As

per the unaudited provisional financial statement,

the SLPA recorded a profit of Rs. 8.7 billion in

2018 before taxes, in comparison to the profit of

Rs. 12.0 billion before taxes recorded in 2017.

During 2018, the total revenue of the SLPA

increased by 18.5 per cent to Rs. 50.1 billion, while

operating expenditure increased by 7.4 per cent

to Rs. 30.0 billion. In addition, foreign exchange

losses of the SLPA increased considerably to

Rs.11.3 billion during the year, compared to

Rs. 2.2 billion in 2017.

Communication Services

The telecommunication sector recorded

further growth with rising telephone and

internet connections in 2018. The total

number of mobile telephone connections

increased significantly by 15.4 per cent to

32.5 million connections in 2018. Total fixed

wireline telephone connections increased by

1.5 per cent, while total fixed wireless connections

showed a decline of 9.7 per cent. Overall, total fixed

telephone connections declined by 4.6 per cent to

2.5 million connections during 2018. Meanwhile,

total internet connections recorded a growth of

23.0 per cent in 2018 with the support of increased

fixed internet connections. Fixed internet

connections grew by 25.2 per cent to 1,530,099,

while mobile internet connections increased by

22.4 per cent to 5,733,062 connections during

2018. With these developments, total telephone

penetration (connections per 100 persons) rose

to 161.6 with fixed telephone penetration and

mobile telephone penetration at 11.5 and 150.1,

respectively. In the meantime, internet penetration

(connections per 100 persons) stood at 33.5 by

end 2018, compared to 27.5 at end 2017.

The Telecommunications Regulatory

Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) took

measures with a focus on quality assurance in

the telecommunication industry during 2018.

Apart from the regulatory activities, the TRCSL

finalised the preliminary design of its head office

extension project in Colombo and the project

is to be completed in 2019, while the Colombo

Lotus Tower project of the TRCSL is expected

to be completed in mid 2019. The TRCSL, in

collaboration with the Urban Development Authority

(UDA), aims to develop a master plan to develop

the neighbourhood of the Colombo Lotus Tower

as a public attraction. Accordingly, the TRCSL has

taken the initiative to develop the adjoining land

into a multifunctional vehicle park complex along

with recreational facilities. The Cabinet of Ministers

has already approved land allocation and the UDA

is entrusted to acquire and transfer the land.

The government continued its efforts to

develop the economy through digitalisation.

Accordingly, the Ministry of Digital Infrastructure and

Information Technology was involved in projects to

improve digital literacy of students and teachers,

information technology literacy of senior citizens,

information and communication technology (ICT)

usage of government officers, logical analysis

competency of students and conducted television

and radio programmes for awareness about

digitisation. In addition, the Sri Lanka Computer

Emergency Readiness Team Coordination Centre,

which is involved in monitoring the network security

of government organisations, implemented

the Cyber Security Capacity and Infrastructure

Development project to deliver comprehensive

security assessments for the ICT infrastructure of

government organisations.

The Information and Communication

Technology Agency (ICTA) continued its

activities to promote ICT services in the

country. During 2018, the ICTA was involved in

several projects to enhance the accessibility of ICT

services in the country. In this regard, the ICTA

implemented the Lanka Government Network 2.0,

and 860 government organisations were digitally

connected through this network. Meanwhile, an

improved industry standard version of centralised

Lanka Government Cloud was established during

2018 under the Lanka Government Cloud 2.0

project, to reduce operational costs and improve

service delivery. In order to increase efficiency

and productivity in the management of the

Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF) related services,

the ICTA implemented the ETF Management

System project. Further, the ICTA implemented

the Development of Electronic Services project to

develop key government online services, a Citizen

Empowerment and Connectivity Development

project to install public Wi-Fi, and an eParliament

project to establish an Electronic Document

Management System for the Parliament. The Digital

Libraries for Knowledge Enhancement project

was implemented to establish libraries with digital

equipment. Moreover, the ICTA conducted several

workshops and training programmes for public

officials to enhance awareness about digitalisation

of the country through its projects during 2018.

The Department of Posts (DOP) continued

its services incorporating concepts of

modern technology and new market strategy

to improve efficiency and productivity in the

postal service. By end 2018, the DOP included

653 main post offices, 3,410 sub post offices, 524

agency post offices, 101 rural agency post offices

and 4 estate agency post offices. Through the

network of main post offices and sub post offices,

the DOP developed an online transaction service

to deliver efficient postal services. The financial

performance of the DOP continued to record a

loss as in previous years. However, the operating

loss of the DOP decreased by 7.4 per cent to

Rs. 5.1 billion in 2018, in comparison to the loss of

Rs. 5.6 billion in 2017. Postal services, financial

services and social and obligatory services have

increased the revenue of the DOP by 10.2 per

cent to Rs. 7.7 billion, while operating expenditure

increased by 2.4 per cent to Rs. 12.9 billion in 2018.

Meanwhile, the DOP implemented an e-Commerce

Development Activity Plan to encourage small and

medium entrepreneurs to access the international

market and sell their products online. In addition, the

DOP diversified and expanded its services to areas,

such as the use of alternative transport methods,

speed post service, development of inland parcel

service, introduction of the virtual postal facility and

e-Card system, to enhance its revenue.

Water Supply and Irrigation

The National Water Supply and Drainage

Board (NWS&DB) continued to expand its

services to meet the rising demand for new

water connections while ensuring equitable

access to safe and affordable drinking water.

The NWS&DB provided 109,482 new water

supply connections in 2018. Accordingly, the

total number of connections managed by the

NWS&DB reached a total of 2.3 million, registering

a 4.9 per cent increase in comparison to 2017.

In 2018, the proportion of non-revenue water

decreased to 41.7 per cent from 43.1 per cent in

the Colombo city area and to 24.9 per cent from

25.2 per cent in the country. It is important to take

measures to minimise losses that are generated by

non-revenue water while strengthening maintenance

services and establishing a comprehensive

measuring, monitoring and reviewing process. In

order to reduce the levels of non-revenue water

usage, which is the difference between the volume of

water pumped into the water supply system and the

volume of water that is billed as authorised consumption,

the NWS&DB has to take action to rehabilitate existing

decayed infrastructure as well as address shortcomings

in meter readings and illegal connections.

The NWS&DB implemented several water

supply development projects in 2018 while

increasing the level of access to safe drinking

water. Accordingly, access to safe drinking water

has increased to 90.6 per cent of the population and

accessibility to pipe borne water also increased to

50.5 per cent by the end of the year. During the year,

the NWS&DB commenced several major water

supply projects in Anuradhapura North, Kandy

North–Pathadumbara and Hemmathagama, which

will improve water service facilities to more than

830,000 beneficiaries in the next two decades.

Meanwhile, 29 major water supply schemes were

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

105

carried out throughout the country with local and

foreign funds during 2018. The NWS&DB plans

to implement 13 priority water supply projects to

cover several suburban and rural areas, targeting

around 1.7 million beneficiaries in the period

ahead.

The financial position of the NWS&DB

remained weak in 2018. The total revenue

increased by 4 per cent to Rs. 24.8 billion mainly

due to the higher number of connections provided

during the year while operational and maintenance

cost also increased by 11.4 per cent to Rs. 27.7

billion. Compared to the operational profit recorded in

2017, the NWS&DB reported an operational loss of

Rs. 1.8 billion in 2018. Increased expenditure owing to

electricity charges, debt service payment and salaries

and wages mainly contributed in weakening the

financial position of the NWS&DB.

Construction work of several major

irrigation projects progressed in 2018. The

Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga Development Project,

which was a major component of the Mahaweli Master

Plan, was completed with a view to providing irrigation

facilities for 82,000 hectares of lands in both Yala

and Maha seasons, and 5,000 hectares of new land

for agriculture development in the Northern, North

Central, Eastern and North Western Provinces. Also

the project will add 25 MW capacity of hydropower

to the national grid. Meanwhile, construction work

on the 9 km water transfer canal, in the mountainous

terrain from the Kalu Ganga Reservoir, linking the

8 km tunnel from the Moragahakanda Reservoir

commenced during the year. Many reservoir projects

including the Deduru Oya Reservoir Project, Menik

Ganga Reservoir Project and Rambukkan Oya

Reservoir Project were continued in 2018. Further, the

Uma Oya downstream development project, which

was under the purview of the Irrigation Department,

recorded a 72 per cent physical progress at end 2018.

Meanwhile, the Kelani River Bund Protection project

was launched in 2018 with the view to protecting

people and other infrastructure from flood situations.

Moreover, to increase the climate resilience of

infrastructure, the Climate Resilience Improvement

Project (CRIP) continued in 2018, covering 21 major

irrigation schemes in the country.

3.3 Social Infrastructure Policies,

The government continued to strengthen the

provision of health services in 2018. Accordingly,

various physical infrastructure development

projects, including upgrading of Emergency

Treatment Units in hospitals, construction work

of the Millennium ward complex at the Teaching

Hospital in Kalubowila and construction of a

Nursing Faculty at the University of Colombo were

in progress during 2018. The establishment of

specialised paediatric care complexes in Karapitiya,

Ampara and Jaffna hospitals also progressed

during the year. Moreover, as a result of the various

initiatives in the health sector, Sri Lanka has been

recognised by the World Health Organisation as

having adequately contained Rubella and the

Congenital Rubella Syndrome in 2018. According

to provisional health sector data, by end 2018 there

were 613 government hospitals with 3.5 beds for

every 1,000 persons in the country. Further, there

was one qualified doctor for every 1,035 persons

and one nurse for every 599 persons in government

hospitals by end 2018.

Steps were taken to address the spread of

communicable diseases such as Influenza,

Dengue and Leptospirosis during the year. The

seasonal Influenza outbreak posed challenges to

the health sector in 2018. Accordingly, 108,158

cases with symptoms similar to the Influenza illness

were reported, while 41 deaths were recorded

due to Influenza during the year. An elevated

number of patients with influenza like symptoms

were reported in the Southern Province during

the months of May and June 2018. Children,

the elderly, pregnant women and patients with

chronic diseases and lower immunity levels

were more prone to the Influenza virus. Hence,

primary schools in the six education zones

and preschools in the Southern Province were

temporarily shut down in May 2018 to contain

the spread of an Influenza outbreak. The

situation was controlled by end June 2018 with

preventive measures such as health education

campaigns, regulated issuance of anti-viral drugs

and personal protective equipment and training

of relevant staff on the mitigation of influenza

outbreaks. Meanwhile, the incidence of Dengue

recorded a significant drop with the number of the

patients declining by 72.3 per cent to 51,591 in

2018, compared to 186,101 in the previous year.

A higher number of Dengue cases were reported

during the months of June, July, November and

December 2018 following the heavy monsoon

rains. The Dengue fatality rate also decreased

to 0.11 per cent in 2018, from 0.24 per cent in

2017, supported by various measures taken by

the epidemiology unit with enhanced surveillance

and case management. Accordingly, steps were

taken to establish dedicated units in several

hospitals with additional equipment and trained

emergency teams for rapid deployment in local

outbreak situations. Further, mosquito control

activities were strengthened through regular

cleaning campaigns, inspection and litigation

in both private and public premises to prevent

mosquito breeding areas while conducting

regular awareness campaigns. Moreover, 1,287

mosquito prevention field assistants, recruited in

a phased manner, were deployed to identify and

eliminate mosquito breeding sites in high risk areas.

Meanwhile, the incidence of Leptospirosis cases

registered a significant increase of 44.8 per cent to

5,249 in 2018, compared to 3,626 in the previous

year. The national programme of Leptospirosis

focused on both reduction of the incidence and the

fatality rate from Leptospirosis as well as outbreak

prevention. Regular outbreaks of communicable

diseases in the country highlight the importance

of epidemic preparedness activities, such as

continuous vector control programmes, public

awareness campaigns, and maintenance of

sufficient stocks of required medicines and

vaccines. In the long run, it is crucial to increase

the health sector cadre with increased public

and private sector investment in medical and

para-medical education in order to combat these

regularly occurring epidemics.

During the year, the Ministry of Health,

Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine (MOH)

continued its initiatives aimed at preventing

and controlling acute and chronic

Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). NCDs

have become a challenge to the health sector

with demographic, socio-economic and lifestyle

transitions that are taking place in the country.

Accordingly, the MOH strengthened primary

care facilities to treat NCDs while conducting

awareness sessions. A ‘National Nutrition Month’

was conducted in Colombo to increase awareness

among the general public under the theme, ‘Right

Way to Reduce Abdominal Obesity’. Meanwhile,

the government took measures to regulate the

prices of selected medicines and medical devices

during the year. During 2018, the MOH took

various measures to address the malnutrition

issue that included the implementation of District

Nutrition Action Plans to upgrade nutrition

levels of the country and strengthen nutrition

levels at preschools through teacher training

programmes. In addition, the MOH strengthened

nutrition surveillance to monitor food security

and individual nutrition status in children with

nutrition problems, conducted pilot testing of new

supplementary food that has higher energy than

‘Thriposha’ for Moderate Acute Malnourished

(MAM) children and set up a Nutrition Steering

Committee to address the malnutrition issue as

well.

The Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown

aetiology (CKDu) continued to be a major

health issue, particularly in rural areas of

Sri Lanka. The number of CKD patients

increased to 28,114 by end 2018 from 27,530 in

2017, while the prevalence level, i.e., number of

CKD/CKDu cases reported as a percentage

of the total population, reached 0.88 per cent

by 2018. Screening of individuals above the

age of 20 years, who live in high-risk areas,

continued during the year in order to facilitate

early diagnosis of CKD/CKDu. Meanwhile, the

construction of 13 new renal clinics was completed

in high-risk areas and the construction of five

other renal units commenced during the year in

Badulla, Jaffna, Hambantota, Trincomalee and

Batticaloa Hospitals. In addition, construction

work of 16 kidney dialysis units was completed in

CKD/CKDu prevalent areas, while construction of

two other kidney dialysis units were ongoing at

the Base Hospitals in Homagama and Puttlam.

Further, research studies into the aetiology of

CKDu are ongoing and the baseline assessment

was completed for a sample of 5,000 patients in

2018.

The private sector continued to play

an important role in providing healthcare

services in 2018. By end 2018, there were 200

registered private hospitals with 5,120 beds that

included 23 private Ayurvedic hospitals with 454

beds. With growing income levels, increasing

communicable diseases and an aging population,

the demand for private health services has been

rising rapidly over time. Within this context, while

facilitating the growth of private sector service

provision, regulation of the private healthcare

sector is vital to ensure the quality standards in

service delivery, healthy competition, competitive

pricing and to prevent the exploitation of patients

by private healthcare providers. Accordingly,

the MOH intensely engaged in inspection,

observation visits, establishment of a proper

information system on Private Medical Institutions

(PMIs), registration and renewal of licensing of

PMIs, granting preliminary approval to establish

new PMIs after evaluating the project proposals

as well as improving the complaints handling

procedure by investigating and enforcing timely

remedial actions against PMIs. One of the key

impediments for the growth of private healthcare

sector is the insufficient healthcare insurance

penetration, which makes the services less

affordable for the general public. In this regard, it

is important to popularise healthcare insurance,

especially among the upper middle-income

groups, in order to reduce the burden of private

healthcare costs on households, particularly in

the context of a rapidly aging population.

Education

Policy initiatives and education reforms

aimed at improving the level of general

education continued during 2018. Accordingly,

the Ministry of Education (MOE), in collaboration

with relevant stakeholders, developed a medium

term strategic plan for the period 2018-2025, in line

with the government policy agenda. This plan has

four key thrust areas that include strengthening

of equity in education and improving quality of

general education. The MOE, together with the

National Institution of Education (NIE) and the

Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational

Training (MSDVT), implemented initiatives aimed

at promoting the ‘13 years of guaranteed education’

programme in 2018. Under this programme, students

have the opportunity to study a vocational subject

stream that would comprise both generic and applied

components. Pilot projects that commenced in 2017

were implemented in a total of 195 schools by 2018.

These pilot projects included holding of workshops

and awareness programmes, provision of physical

resources, student admission and teacher training

as well as recruitment activities. Meanwhile, the

MOE took steps to provide training to students in the

second year of study under the vocational stream,

in collaboration with MSDVT, to provide certification

equivalent to NVQ level 4 while engaging in initial

discussions with other relevant institutions, including

the private sector. The NIE implemented measures

aimed at curriculum development during 2018,

which included the development of 26 modules for

vocational subjects under the ‘13 years of guaranteed

education programme’.

Efforts to improve the quality of general

education progressed through cadre

enhancements and infrastructure development

activities. A total of 2,186 teachers, which included

867 for national schools and 1,319 for provincial

schools, were recruited to support the education cadre

during 2018. Moreover, around 24,260 teachers

and 8,150 schools were evaluated externally by the

Ministry of Education, Provincial Departments of

Education, Zonal Education Offices and Divisional

Education Offices during the year to maintain the

quality standards of general education in government

schools. Human resource development programmes

were conducted to develop competencies of both

educators and administrators. Selected special

education teachers were trained in autism, braille

and computer education, while 140 primary school

teachers were trained in skills to educate students

with learning difficulties. Meanwhile, an outline for

a national policy for STEM (science, technology,

engineering and mathematics) education was

prepared and forwarded to the National Education

Commission. Principals from 3,000 Type 2 schools

were trained in handling mobile laboratory kits that are

provided to schools to support the quality of science

education. The government continued to improve

the physical infrastructure of the institutions engaged

in general education activities, which included

initiatives under the ‘Nearest School is the Best

School’ programme. Work implemented under this

rolling plan included development of technological

laboratories and technological faculties. In addition,

repairing of 6,000 school buildings and construction

of 5,600 new classrooms continued during the year.

Meanwhile, the MOE had allocated Rs. 250 million for

the refurbishment of the national library in Colombo.

Numerous initiatives aimed at expanding

computer facilities and information technology

education progressed during the year. A pilot

programme to establish 350 digital classrooms

to introduce digital education was planned during

2018-2019. In tandem with the rise in internet

usage, measures were taken to establish school

level internet safety readiness teams, and 700

trainers were trained on cyber safety and other

related aspects under this initiative. Meanwhile, the

MOE was in the process of formulating a National

Master Plan for Information and Communication

Technology Education. The government continued

to provide free school uniforms and shoes through

vouchers to around 4.3 million students and

720,000 students, respectively, incurring a cost of

over Rs. 3.6 billion in total during the year. The

‘Suraksha’ insurance scheme, which provides

benefits for diseases, accidents and other injuries

for all students in the age range of 5 to 19 years

and in grades 1 to 13, provided insurance claims

amounting to Rs. 480 million during the year.

The involvement of non-state institutions

in the general education sector continued to

increase during 2018. The institutional framework

that provided non-state general education

services included 106 private schools (excluding

international schools) and 759 pirivenas during

2018. The number of students studying in private

schools (excluding international schools) grew by

1.5 per cent to 138,526 students, while students

receiving education at pirivenas declined by

3.9 per cent to 60,440 students during 2018.

Meanwhile, based on a survey carried out by

the MOE in 2018 there were 294 international

schools providing education services during the

year. Amidst increased private sector participation

in the provision of education services with the

rising demand for such services, the need for

strengthening the regulation, monitoring and

quality assurance mechanism to encompass all

institutions providing these services is necessary

to ensure the quality of general education.

The government, with the support of the

private sector, continued efforts aimed at

developing human capital through measures

to improve accessibility and quality of higher

education. The total undergraduate student

population enrolled within universities and

higher education institutions under the purview

of the University Grants Commission (UGC)

increased during 2018 amidst the introduction

of new programmes. Meanwhile, the UGC

granted approval for two new faculties, 27 new

departments, and 12 new undergraduate and

seven new postgraduate degree programmes

during the year. Amidst the introduction of new

programmes, measures to improve the quality

of higher education were also implemented.

Accordingly, the Accelerating Higher Education

Expansion and Development (AHEAD) project

was launched during the year while the Quality

Assurance Council of the UGC continued

activities to strengthen the higher education

sector of the country. Meanwhile, the UGC

continued to provide financial assistance for

academic staff to pursue postgraduate studies,

which included opportunities through various

agreements with foreign universities to support

their knowledge base. The private sector also

provided education opportunities amidst limited

availability of opportunities in the public sector.

Accordingly, there were 17 Non-State Higher

Education Institutions (NSHEI) offering 122 degree

programmes by end 2018. While the Standing

Committee of Accreditation and Quality Assurance

(SCAQA) carried out activities to ensure quality

standards in the NSHEI sector, measures were

taken to introduce a policy on higher education and

to formulate a legal framework to bring the entire

sector under one entity. Accordingly, initiatives

have been taken to establish a Quality Assurance

and Accreditation Commission that would regulate

all higher education institutes in the country.

Amidst these developments that are taking place

within the university education system, emphasis

has to be given to improving the graduate profile

in line with the dynamic comparative advantage of

the economy.

The Technical and Vocational Education

and Training (TVET) sector continued to

provide education opportunities to enhance

skill levels of the workforce during 2018.

Both the public sector and the private and non-

governmental institutions were engaged in

providing TVET education through the network of

525 public institutions, and 622 private and non-

governmental institutions that were registered

by end 2018. These institutions provided a total

of 2,089 accredited courses in a wide range of

technical and vocational subject areas. Meanwhile,

although the TVET sector issued 61,150 National

Vocational Qualification certificates during the

year, there is a need to improve the capacity of

the sector to increase access to youth who do not

have the opportunity to pursue higher education

opportunities within the university system.

Accordingly, under the ‘13 years guaranteed

education’ programme, students from selected

schools are to attend courses in 19 selected

Colleges of Technology and Technical colleges.

In 2018, the Tertiary and Vocational Education

Commission drafted a report to introduce a TVET

rationalisation programme to improve courses to

cater to rapid technological changes and increase

employability of TVET graduates.

Housing and Urban Development

The government took various initiatives

to develop housing and urban development

activities through institutions under its purview

in 2018. The Ministry of Housing, Construction

and Cultural Affairs (MHCCA) carried out policy

measures that included the revision of the National

Housing Policy to accommodate emerging trends

in urbanisation, impact of natural disasters and

sustainable human settlement development. The

final draft of the policy was presented to the Cabinet

of Ministers for approval in 2018. Meanwhile, the

Ministry was in the process of amending the Rent

Act and the Condominium Management Authority

Act to suit the present day needs. The Treasury

allocation for activities under the MHCCA stood at

Rs. 10.2 billion for 2018, which included funds for

programmes implemented by the National Housing

Development Authority (NHDA) and the Urban

Settlement Development Authority (USDA). These

programmes included initiatives to provide housing

for low income families, resettlement of families in

Northern and Eastern Provinces and infrastructure

development of rural villages. In addition,

Rs. 1.2 billion was raised as internal funds,

while Rs.373.8 million from other funding

sources was allocated for the National Housing

Programme. Construction work of 50 model villages

was carried out during the year with financial

assistance from the government of India. This

project, at a cost of Rs. 600 million, is scheduled

to construct 1,200 housing units. Meanwhile, the

government of India has agreed to provide four

more aid projects of Rs.300 million each to build

600 housing units, and the two countries have

entered into memoranda of understanding for

two of the projects. The ‘Lunawa Urban Housing

Project’ targeting the low income urban community

recorded a financial progress of Rs. 1,234 million

by end 2018. Meanwhile, the NHDA carried out the

‘Semata Sevana’ housing programme benefitting

around 17,400 families in various parts of the country

while commencing nine housing projects aimed at

public servants in 2018. The Construction Industry

Development Authority (CIDA) implemented

initiatives to develop the domestic construction

industry. The CIDA commenced registration of

qualified persons, providing of technical auditing

services and registration of quality management

auditors to support quality standards in the industry.

Meanwhile, the CIDA conducted skills development

programmes including ‘Shilpa Saviya’ to train youth

as craftsmen in order to address the shortage of

labour in the construction industry.

The Ministry of Megapolis and Western

Development (MMWD) continued to implement

its programmes aimed at developing urban

communities in the country. These initiatives

included projects to address issues related to the

transportation sector. The MMWD took measures to

develop Multi Modal Transport Centres (MMTC) that

are based on the concept of ‘park and ride’, restructure

and revise bus services, implement bus priority lanes

to address transport issues identified in the Western

Region Megapolis Master Plan. Accordingly, all

structural work of the Makumbura MMTC was

completed by end 2018, while construction work

related to stage one of the Kadawatha MMTC

commenced in October 2018. Meanwhile, the bus

priority lane project that commenced in 2017, aimed

at improving public transport, continued in 2018 and

is expected to be completed in the first half of 2019.

A pre-feasibility study of the Western Region Light

Rail Transit (LRT) project has been completed in

2018 and the Ministry is expected to complete the

feasibility study by early 2019. In this regard, a loan

agreement was signed in March 2019 between the

Sri Lankan government and the Japan International

Cooperation Agency (JICA) for engineering services

and construction of the LRT line. The social impact

assessment and resettlement action plan are

expected to be completed by April 2019, while the

environmental impact assessment is expected to be

completed by June 2019. Meanwhile, approval of the

Cabinet of Ministers was received for the ‘Sahasara’

project in 2018 that was designed to address issues

within the public transport system. This project is

expected to provide better bus passenger services

to the public using modern technology. The Metro

Colombo Urban Development Project aimed at

reducing flooding in the catchment of the Colombo

water basin and strengthening the capacity of local

authorities in the Colombo metropolitan area to

rehabilitate, improve and maintain local infrastructure

continued in 2018. Work related to the Colombo

Port City Development project continued in 2018.

By end 2018, around 95 per cent of the reclamation

activity was completed together with around

80 per cent of ground improvement work and 97 per

cent of design work under the foreign component of

the investment. Land reclamation activities of the port

city were completed in January 2019. The completion

of this project would establish a world class city that

would include a financial district, luxury living spaces

and office complexes. Meanwhile, the construction

of the New Kelani Bridge and Port Access Elevated

Highway (PAEH) continued during the year under

the local component of the investment. In addition,

the feasibility study and the environment impact

assessment were completed for the underground

extension of the Marine Drive to the PAEH.

The UDA under the MMWD was involved in

urban development activities during 2018. A

survey that has been conducted by the UDA has

identified a total of 68,812 families living in 1,499

underserved settlements. Accordingly, the Urban

Regeneration Project of the MMWD has been

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2018

implemented with a view to eliminating shanties,

slums and other dilapidated housing from the

Colombo city and relocating dwellers in modern

houses. Housing development activities under

this project involved an expenditure of Rs. 17.1

billion by end 2018. The demand for middle income

housing in urban areas has been on the rise.

The UDA initiated several housing programmes

to meet the demand from middle income groups,

which included a housing scheme for government

sector employees with facilities for obtaining a

loan under favourable terms from a commercial

bank. Meanwhile, with increased demand for

housing from residents as well as non-residents,

the private sector involvement in providing housing

units, particularly in the form of apartments, has

increased notably in recent times.

Poverty Alleviation and Safety Nets

Poverty levels in the country have

continued to decline as per the Household

Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) 2016

of the Department of Census and Statistics

(DCS). Accordingly, the Poverty Headcount Ratio

(PHCR) stood at 4.1 per cent in 2016. However,

a considerable portion of the population was just

above the poverty line and are at a high risk of

falling below the poverty threshold due to shocks,

such as natural disasters and price hikes of basic

commodities. Meanwhile, as per the World Bank

classification, 0.8 per cent of the population of Sri

Lanka was below the international poverty line of

US dollars 1.90 per day (in 2011 Purchasing Power

Parity terms) in 2016, compared to 1.9 per cent in

2012. The population below the international lower

middle income and upper middle income poverty

lines, which have thresholds of US dollars 3.20 per

day and US dollars 5.50 per day, respectively, stood

at 10.1 per cent and 40.4 per cent, respectively,

in 2016. Hence, although Sri Lanka has made

significant progress as reflected through the PHCR,

continued efforts are required to elevate people

above all poverty thresholds. Meanwhile, there has

been a wide disparity in the PHCR at the district

level. As reported in the HIES 2016, the highest

level of the PHCR of 18.2 per cent was recorded

in Kilionochchi, compared to the lowest level of 0.9

per cent recorded in Colombo. The contribution

to poverty in absolute terms was the highest from

the Kandy district at 9.1 per cent while the lowest

contribution was from the Mannar district at 0.1 per

cent. Moreover, although the PHCR has witnessed

a steady decline over time, income distribution has

remained relatively stagnant. Household income

inequality as measured through the Gini coefficient

at 0.45 per cent in 2016 witnessed only a marginal

improvement compared to the Gini coefficient of

0.48 recorded under HIES-2012/13.

Numerous government initiatives aimed

at providing social safety nets and poverty

alleviation continued during 2018. In this regard,

the Department of Samurdhi Development (DSD)

carried out various programmes during the year,

which included the Samurdhi Subsidy Programme

and the Samurdhi Social Security Benefit Scheme.

Moreover, under the latter programme, Rs. 1.2

billion was disbursed among 282,013 beneficiaries

during 2018 while Samurdhi Banking Societies

continued to provide micro-loans to entrepreneurs.

Meanwhile, as per the empowerment plan prepared

by the DSD, in line with the United Nations

Sustainable Development Goals to alleviate poverty

by 2030, various projects were carried out during

the year. Accordingly, a total of 21,412 projects at

a cost of Rs. 910 million were implemented in 2018

to empower families through agricultural, animal

husbandry, fisheries projects, together with self-

employment and industrial development projects.

In addition, the Budget 2019 has proposed to

facilitate the addition of around 600,000 households

while streamlining the Samurdhi programme to

make it more effective. The Budget also proposes

to allow the withdrawal up to Rs. 30,000 in two

installments from Samurdhi compulsory savings

during 2019. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Women

and Child Affairs and Dry Zone Development

carried out programmes to improve the nutritional

status of expecting and lactating mothers and pre-

school children. In order to support the nutrition

level of primary school children, the Budget 2019

proposes to provide a free glass of milk to students

in rural schools of the country. While numerous

measures have been carried out to improve the

wellbeing of vulnerable segments in the population,

implementation of a mechanism to assess eligible

recipients for poverty alleviation programmes

through suitable multi-dimensional measures

is essential to ensure the effectiveness of such

programmes. The Welfare Benefits Board is in the

process of establishing a National Social Registry to

serve the purpose of providing an effective platform

for planning, monitoring and evaluation of welfare

programmes. The National Social Registry, once

implemented, would facilitate better planning,

implementation and coordination of welfare

programmes in the country, amidst challenges

in alleviating poverty, such as the existence of

poverty pockets, changing demographic conditions

and increased incidence of natural disasters. The

establishment of a national social registry would

support better resource utilisation by channelling

resources to the needy.

Environment

The government continued its efforts to

strengthen the institutional framework for the

preservation of the environment in order to

maintain a balance between the environment

and economic growth to achieve sustainable

development. Accordingly, the Ministry of Disaster

Management implemented several projects during

2018 to mitigate the risk of disasters. Implementation

of landslide mitigation and slope stabilisation

projects, public awareness programmes and

resettlement of vulnerable communities were tasks

carried out by the Ministry of Disaster Management

to reduce the impact of disasters. In addition, the

early warning system was strengthened to permit

timely evacuation of vulnerable communities.

Meanwhile, constructing district level secondary

data systems related to disasters, disaster

uncovering and disaster vulnerability analysis were

selected as key components of the methodology

for a Disaster Risk Assessment and to prepare a

Risk Index. Moreover, under the Risk Assessment

Project, a national training programme on 'Application

of Disaster Risk Assessment for Development

Planning and Effective Emergency Response' was

conducted in 2018, for officers from the Disaster

Management Centre and other stakeholders,

covering practical aspects of risk assessment for

the successful implementation of a National Risk

Assessment project. Meanwhile, the Department

of Meteorology issued 111 warnings for marine

activities and 60 warnings for the land area. Further,

it provided timely advisories and warnings to the

general public, disaster management authorities

and the Department of Fisheries to carry out early

preparations to withstand two severe cyclones

‘GAJA’ and ‘PETHAI’ that originated in the Bay

of Bengal and moved very close to Sri Lanka in

2018.

The Central Environmental Authority (CEA)

continued its activities to protect, manage and

enhance the resources and the environment

of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the CEA continued

with implementing national standards, criteria

and guidelines on environment related matters

with the issuance of certificates and licenses,

and the adoption of new environmental laws and

regulations. The CEA is responsible for evaluating

projects and issuing Environmental Impact

Assessment (EIA) and Initial Environmental

Examination (IEE) certificates based on the

environmental feasibility of the project. During

2018, the CEA granted EIA approvals for 17

projects and IEE approvals for 306 projects while

the Environmental Protection Licenses (EPL) also

continued to be issued to industries as a regulatory

measure on environmental protection. Further, the

CEA was involved in regulating polythene usage,

streamlining and improving existing EIA laws,

regulations and procedures for smooth function,

declaration and management of Environmental

Protection Areas under the National Environmental

Act (NEA), implementing of hazardous waste

management regulations, monitoring major

water bodies of the country on water quality, and

implementing and regulating waste management

projects to ensure environmental sustainability.

The Forest Department continued its

development programmes with a focus on

increasing the forest cover of the country.

During the year, the Forest Department carried

out reforestation in 977 hectares. Moreover, the

assisted re-planting programme under the World

Food Programme, which commenced in 2017

continued successfully in 2018 as well. Accordingly,

the ‘WanaRopa’ national tree planting programme

was launched during the year, with a view to

achieving the target of increasing the forest cover

in Sri Lanka from 29.7 per cent to 32.0 per cent

of the total land area. Further, with the support of

United Nations Programme on Reducing Emissions

from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (UN-

REDD), Sri Lanka produced a five-year (2018 –

2022) National REDD+ Investment Framework and

Action Plan (NRIFAP) covering various policies and

measures. In 2018, the extent reforested increased

by 2.2 per cent over 2017. The number of forest

offences decreased to 3,757 in 2018 from 3,887

during the previous year, while the value of timber

detected as having been illegally logged decreased

by 7.1 per cent in 2018. Further, the private sector

also initiated reforesting projects to enhance the

total forest cover during the year, including a unique

mission to drop ‘Seed Bombs’ in a forest reserve in

the North Central region during an aerial operation

by the Sri Lanka Air Force.
