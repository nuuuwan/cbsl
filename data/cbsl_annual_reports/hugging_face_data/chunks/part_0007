Introduction\n\n2. Importance of the Stability of the Banking System and Lessons Learnt from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC)\n\nBanking sector stability is vital for efficient financial intermediation in order to promote economic growth and welfare of people. This is more important during economic shocks and stressful circumstances. However, throughout history, breach of trust in the banking system and depositor runs have caused significant negative impact on the economic activities across the globe, leading to systemic financial crises. Common causes of these systemic crises can be mainly identified as high leverage, booming credit, weakening of credit evaluation standards, lapses in governance and risk management, property and other asset bubbles, excessive exposure to the government, inadequate supervision, and often a high external current account deficit. As revealed by international examples such as the East Asian crisis (1997), GFC (2007-2008) and European crisis (2010), the financial distress resulting from a systemic crisis typically lasts for several years, largely resulting in considerable economic contractions and high fiscal costs, affecting the entire society.\n\nLessons Learnt from the GFC\n\nThe GFC of 2007-2008, even though comprising of similarities with past events, was rapidly transmitted across the globe in an unprecedented manner, well beyond the directly affected countries. The main reason for the high degree of contagion of GFC was the origination of the crisis in advanced economies\n\nBOX 9The Role of Central Banks in Preventing Systemic Financial Crises and Restoring Public Confidence in the Banking Sector"

An effective crisis management framework would generally comprise the following pillars (International Monetary Fund, 2020):\n\n(i) An institutional framework for crisis preparedness\n\n(ii) Supervisory early intervention\n\n(iii) Emergency liquidity assistance\n\n(iv) Resolution of financial institutions\n\n(i) An Institutional Framework for Crisis Preparedness\n\nIn order for a crisis management framework to be effective, a strong and independent institutional framework with effective policy coordination between the core entities of the financial safety-net is vital. The core entities of the financial safety-net can be identified as the Central Bank, financial supervisory and regulatory agencies, resolution authority, and Ministry of Finance. These entities must have clear mandates and adequate independence to be able to prepare, coordinate, and execute the crisis management tasks at any given circumstance.\n\n(ii) Supervisory Early Intervention"

Accordingly, framework for lending under emergency liquidity assistance should be well established by central banks as a crisis preparedness tool. Further, such liquidity provision should be subject to safeguards of protecting central bank balance sheets while reducing moral hazard.\n\nPrior to GFC, the underlying concept of emergency liquidity assistance was that central banks should lend only to those banks possessing good collateral, with the assumption that a bank which lacks such collateral was insolvent. The key lessons learnt from GFC, which helped central banks to make significant improvements in the framework for lending under emergency liquidity assistance, can be summarised as follows (International Monetary Fund, 2020):"

Crisis Management Tools Adopted by CBSL\n\n3.2.1. Lender of Last Resort: Framework on ELA\n\nAs per the existing Monetary Law Act (MLA) No. 58 of 1949, under its core objective of financial system stability, CBSL is entrusted with the ultimate responsibility of ensuring public confidence on the financial system. In this context, acting as the Lender of Last Resort (LOLR) is one of the key roles to be undertaken by CBSL to minimise any adverse implications that may arise in the financial system by promoting the safety and soundness of financial institutions.\n\nAs the LOLR for the Sri Lankan banking sector, CBSL is empowered and responsible for exercising applicable provisions/measures available under MLA to\n\npre-empt any adverse developments that might cause any systemic financial panic. Accordingly, CBSL established the framework on ELA in 2020, under Section 86 of MLA to prevent any threat to monetary and banking stability. Strengthening the liquidity position of banking institutions to ensure continued supply of credit to the economy and to meet urgent liquidity requirements during exceptional circumstances, thereby maintaining public confidence on the financial system was the main outcome expected from the ELA framework.\n\nIn 2022, the ELA framework of CBSL was further enhanced by incorporating a broader range of collaterals with valuation methodology, criteria on liquidity and solvency assessment, supervisory actions and an improved coordination mechanism among the departments of CBSL that are involved in executing the framework.\n\n3.2.2. Salient Features of the ELA Framework"

Strengthening the Bank Resolution Framework\n\nCBSL considered the Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions issued by Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems issued by the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) when drafting the Banking (Special Provisions) Act. It is expected to enact the proposed Banking (Special Provisions) Act during 2023.\n\n3.2.4. Establishing a Crisis Management Committee\n\nThe present unprecedented levels of financial and economic distresses in Sri Lanka have given rise to the urgent need of strengthening the policy coordination between competent authorities on financial sector crisis management. The lack of an institutional framework for crisis management has prompted to set up a Financial Sector Crisis Management Committee (FCMC) for\n\npolicy coordination between CBSL and Ministry of Finance to focus on crisis preparedness, to reduce the risk of coordination failures, and to minimise the impact of the financial crisis. The proposed FCMC will be assisted by a Technical Committee on Financial Sector Crisis Management (TCMC) and will function in both crisis and non-crisis times.

GFC showed that a crisis can emerge even in a stable economic environment and merely microprudential policies would not be adequate to prevent such a crisis as regulatory policies were focused on individual institutions with no policies available to deal with systemic risks. Systemic risk is defined as the risk of disruptions to the provision of financial services that is caused by an impairment of all or parts of the financial system and can cause serious negative consequences for the real economy (International Monetary Fund, Financial Stability Board, and Bank for International Settlements, 2009). Hence, GFC raised the need for a strong macroprudential policy framework to constrain the buildup of risks in the financial system. Central Banks in the post GFC era recognised the significance of linkages between the macroeconomy and the financial system vis-a-vis macrofinancial linkages. Thus, it became apparent that it is vital to identify macrofinancial linkages and interdependence of institutions while systemic risks need to be contained by dedicated financial sector policies.\n\nThus, \u2018macroprudential\u2019 refers to an approach to financial regulation that fills the gap between conventional macroeconomic policy and traditional microprudential regulation of individual financial\n\nBOX 10Establishment of a Macroprudential Authority in Sri Lanka\n\ninstitutions (Elliott, 2011).

Generally, three notions of liquidity are relevant to liquidity management.

Especially in crisis times, central bank liquidity provision can be positively associated with funding and market liquidity. In its capacity as the final liquidity provider, the central bank supplies liquidity to the banking system in different ways. Amongst them, lending through Open Market Operations (OMOs) is the principal liquidity management tool to manage reserves in the banking system, thereby steering the short term interest rates in normal economic\n\nFINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY\n\n273\n\n8\n\nconditions. To provide liquidity on a temporary basis, the central bank engages in transactions with financial institutions whereby the central bank buys government securities, agreeing to resell them back to financial institutions later. Also, to offer liquidity on a permanent basis, the central bank buys securities in the secondary market on an outright basis. As OMOs are conducted through competitive bidding auctions, these auctions are not directed at a specific financial institution.

Introducing the Liquidity Assistance Facility of the Central Bank\n\nThis facility is enabled under existing legal provisions, i.e., Sections 82 and 83 (1) (c) of the Monetary Law Act (MLA), No. 58 of 1949, where banking institutions are entitled to obtain credit as a liquidity assistance facility for any fixed period not exceeding 180 days upon promissory notes secured by the pledging of government securities at the cost of the Average Weighted New Deposit Rate (AWNDR) with a margin. The amount of credit granted under this facility is determined by the Central Bank after an assessment of the liquidity requirement of the loan requested bank. With this facility, banks have the opportunity to obtain liquidity for a longer tenure than in the OMOs at a relatively competitive price. The facility avail to address the system-wide liquidity stress and to minimise the effect on banking institutions. Hence, this facility is an effective way of dealing with the stigma1 associated with the emergency liquidity assistance facility.\n\n1 This refers to a financial institution\u2019s hesitance to use the central bank facility, expecting that it may send a negative signal about their financial health\n\nFINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY\n\n275\n\n8"

Introduction\n\nThe financial system plays a crucial role in the functioning of any economy. Financial institutions, while providing financial intermediation, tend to take on higher risk exposures through their diverse and complex deposit liability profiles. Therefore, financial safety net measures are of utmost importance for an economy to protect less sophisticated depositors. Depending on a country\u2019s supervisory structure, multiple organisations play important roles within the country\u2019s financial safety net. However, in some countries, central banks have exclusive responsibility for bank regulation, supervision, and resolution, and provides explicit or implicit deposit insurance protection as well.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the financial system has undergone notable growth and development in recent years and the increasing complexity of the financial system has made it more vulnerable to financial shocks and crises, while underlining the need for robust financial safety net to strengthen the resilience of the financial system and safeguard the interests of depositors and other stakeholders in the financial system. In order to ensure the strength and efficiency of the country\u2019s financial system, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and MOF collaborate closely as the primary stakeholders in the financial safety net.\n\n2. Role of the Central Bank and Ministry of Finance\n\nThe CBSL plays a critical role in the financial safety net mechanism through functions, such as the lender of last resort, the supervisory authority of banks and\n\nBOX 13Strengthening the Financial Safety Net in Sri Lanka"

Lender of Last Resort\n\nDuring times of financial turmoil, banks may encounter challenges in obtaining necessary funding for their daily operations and may turn to their lender of last resort, the CBSL. This can occur when banks become hesitant to lend to each other and depositors begin to withdraw their funds from their bank accounts. In such situations, the CBSL serves as the lender of last resort because its prime responsibility is promoting the smooth functioning of financial markets and maintaining a stable financial system.\n\nThe CBSL generally executes its lender of last resort function during emergencies that induce financial panic and threaten monetary and banking stability. In such circumstances, the CBSL has the discretion to provide extraordinary loans or advances to banks, secured with any collateral defined as acceptable in the Emergency Loans and Advances (ELA) Framework and may also renew such loans or advances as needed.\n\nCurrently, banks are not required to meet any specific requirements to access ELA. However, the CBSL has the discretion over deciding on the applicable interest rates, tenor, renewals, collateral, and other related matters. Nonetheless, if a LB is deemed insolvent, or likely to be insolvent, or has no reasonable prospect of becoming solvent in future, such bank would be ineligible for ELA, except in an exceptional circumstance.\n\nELA provided by central banks is typically viewed as a measure to address pure liquidity problems in banks that essentially are solvent. However, such situation is rare in practice. In most cases where banks face liquidity problems, there is some uncertainty about the\n\nCENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022\n\n2928"

Prudential Regulation and Supervisory Frameworks\n\nPrudential regulation establishes standards and policies that financial institutions are expected to adhere to. Under the supervisory framework, it monitors the implementation of these standards and policies to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial sector and to achieve the financial system stability objective.\n\nThe regulatory and supervisory framework for banks and NBFIs of Sri Lanka is primarily specified in the Monetary Law Act (MLA), No.58 of 1949, the Banking Act, No. 30 of 1988, and the Finance Business Act (FBA), No. 42 of 2011. The CBSL is empowered to license banks and finance companies, issue prudential directions, determinations, orders, and guidelines to licensed entities, conduct supervision and examination and enforce regulatory actions, and resolve weak LBs and LFCs. The CBSL adheres to internationally recognised supervisory standards established by the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision. In order to prepare for potential crises, supervisors require banks and NBFIs to develop and implement contingency plans that include measures to address failures of banks and NBFIs.\n\n5. Deposit Insurance System (DIS)\n\nThe role of a deposit insurer is to stabilise the financial system by ensuring public confidence in it, especially in the event of bank failures. The deposit insurer assures depositors that they will have immediate access to their insured funds, even if their bank/NBFI fails, thereby reducing depositors\u2019 the possibility of a \"run\" on the bank/NBFI and the risk of contagion and foster financial system stability, which in turn would have positive spillover on the wider economy."

It underlines the necessity of a well functioning financial safety net to bolster market confidence during periods of financial strains. Enhanced regional cooperation to uphold\n\nFINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY\n\n293\n\n8\n\nfinancial stability and resilience is recognised as vital safeguarding in exigent times. Lack of funding could cause severe challenges and additional costs. Therefore, the resolution authority might resort to resolution techniques that offer required liquidity. In addition, inadequate funding could lead to delays in resolution process. When a resolution authority has to defer resolving an institution, the quality of assets is likely to deteriorate further, and the moral hazard problem becomes more pronounced."

For over a decade, SLDILSS played a crucial \u2018pay box\u2019 role. However, in its efforts to make timely payments to depositors, SLDILSS faces challenges due to inadequate information sharing arrangements regarding depositors, as well as the failure to maintain depositor information under a unique identification number at LBs and LFCs. Addressing these challenges and implementing robust information sharing and identification systems for depositors can go a long way in enhancing the effectiveness of SLDILSS, and ultimately, strengthening the financial system's stability.\n\nGlobally, deposit insurance systems, equipped with broad mandates, are assuming a significant role in the resolution of troubled banks. This arrangement provides the insurer with a greater ability to address costs compared to pure \u2018pay box\u2019 systems. Thus, SLDILSS should adopt the \u201cleast cost\u201d approach for resolving a failed institution. This approach entails closer cooperation and coordination among safety net participants, the Government, regulatory bodies,"

It would be important to broaden CBSL\u2019s regulatory powers and upgrade the resolution framework by setting up a special resolution regime for financial institutions, expanding resolution tools, improving deposit insurance, and enhancing emergency liquidity assistance. The finalisation and adoption of the new Banking (Special Provisions) Act would help in achieving these goals.

In the Statement of Financial Position, assets and liabilities are presented broadly in order of liquidity within such distinguished categories. The Bank considers that this reporting approach provides appropriate reporting of the Bank's activities which are more fully described in Note 7.\n\n2.4 Functional and Presentation Currency\n\nThe Financial Statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR), which is the Bank\u2019s functional currency. Financial information presented in Sri Lankan Rupees has been rounded to the nearest thousand. There was no change in the Bank\u2019s presentation and functional currency during the year under review.\n\n2.5 Materiality and Aggregation\n\nEach material class of similar item is presented separately in the Financial Statements. Items of dissimilar nature or function are presented separately unless they are immaterial.\n\nCentral Bank of Sri LankaNotes to the Financial Statements\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022"

The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, future compensation increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. Assumptions used in the actuarial valuation are disclosed in Note 32 to the Financial Statements.\n\n3.3 Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nWhere the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the Statement of Financial Position cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The inputs to these models are derived from observable market data where possible, but if this is not available, judgment is required to establish fair values. The judgments include considerations of liquidity and model inputs such as volatility for longer\u2013dated derivatives.\n\n3.4 General Implications of Adverse Economic Conditions and COVID-19\n\nThe Bank considered the impact of the adverse economic environment and COVID-19 in preparing the financial statements. While the specific areas of judgement have not changed, the impact of adverse economic conditions and COVID-19 resulted in application of additional judgement and estimates mainly in relation to loans to banks and the expected credit loss assessment in the financial statements."

The fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 50.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nThe fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\n\u2022 In the principal market for the asset or liability, or\n\n\u2022 In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability\n\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Bank.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use."

To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgement and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest rate is set.\n\nIn contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than the minimum exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount outstanding.

Under Stand-By and Extended Arrangements, for instance, a member can currently borrow up to 145 per cent of its quota annually (temporarily increased to 245 percent of quota through end 2021 as part of the Fund's COVID-19 response) and 435 per cent cumulatively. Access to finance may be higher in exceptional circumstances.\n\n(iv) SDR allocations: Members' shares of SDR allocations are established in proportion to their quotas. A general SDR allocation equivalent to about US dollars 650 billion was made to IMF members that are participants in the SDR Department in proportion to their existing quotas in the IMF, which became effective on 23 August 2021.

The SDRs value as a reserve asset derives from the commitments of members to hold and accept SDRs, and to honor various obligations connected with the operation of the SDR system. The IMF ensures that the SDRs claim on freely usable currencies is being honored in two ways: by designating IMF members with a strong external position to"

This account was created under the guidance of the IMF by transferring the balance held in SCA-2 against Sri Lanka when it was decided to wind up SCA-2 by the IMF. The IMF requested the countries that had balances in the Post SCA-2 account to consider providing the balances in that account to the PRGF/HIPC Trust either as outright grant or as a means of providing a subsidy for PRGF/HIPC Loan. Accordingly GOSL agreed to transfer the funds from Post SCA\u20132 accounts to PRGF/HIPC Trust account, not as an outright grant, but as an interest free deposit until 2018. This was later extended until 2024.\n\n11.4 Movement in Expected Credit Losses on IMF Related Assets\n\n2022 2021 Rs. 000 Rs. 000Stage 1\n\nBalance as at 1 January 3 2 Charge/(Reversal) for the Year 5 1 Balance as at 31 December 8 3\n\n12.

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nIn pursuing its policy objectives, CBSL faces various risks, both financial and non-financial in nature. Since the materialization of any of such risks could have an adverse impact on the achievement of objectives, financial position and the reputation of CBSL, having a properly designed risk management framework in place is vital. Accordingly, CBSL has established an Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) Framework to ensure the risks faced by CBSL are properly managed.\n\nThe Risk Governance Framework which was approved by the Monetary Board comprises both a Risk Governance Structure and a Risk Management Structure covering financial and non-financial risks confronted by the Bank. The Risk Governance Structure consists of the Monetary Board (MB) and two Board sub-committees, i.e. the Board Risk Oversight Committee (BROC) and the Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee (MBAAC). The MB holds the ultimate responsibility for the overall risk management function of the Bank and sets the \u201cTone at the Top\u201d.\n\nThe BROC oversees CBSL's overall Risk Management and Compliance Functions via a formal delegation from the MB and is responsible for laying the broad strategy and policies for the Bank\u2019s Risk Management and Compliance functions. The BROC also assists the MB to ensure a dedicated focus on risk management and compliance at the Bank."

FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES\n\n50.1 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities\n\n\u2018Fair Value\u2019 is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Bank has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.\n\nThe determination of fair value for financial assets and liabilities for which there is no observable market price requires the use of valuation techniques as described in accounting policy Note 5.2. For financial instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective, and requires varying degrees\n\nof judgement depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumptions and other risks affecting the specific instrument. The fair value hierarchy of financial instruments is given below:\n\nLevel 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n\nLevel 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and\n\nLevel 3: Fair value measurements using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).\n\nAccounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II"

Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase\n\nb. Securities Lending\n\nSecurities lending describes the established market practice by which, for a fee, securities are transferred temporarily from one party (the lender, i.e. CBSL), to another (the borrower); the borrower is obliged to return them either on demand or at the end of any agreed term. Currently a selected Clearing House (CH) functions as the custodian for the supranational bonds and bonds issued by different issuers. CBSL has signed an agreement which enable CH to lend at their wish depending on the demand for those bonds. Since the lending does not involve CBSL and CH lends them directly to the borrowers, the process is called auto bond lending. At the end of each month, custodian will send fee income for auto bond lending, if any for the bonds which they lent under auto bond lending programme. The Bank continues to recognize the securities in their entirety in the Statement of Financial Position because it retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. These securities are presented in the Statement of Financial Position as \"Securities at Fair value through other Comprehensive Income\".\n\nc. Securities Pledged\n\nIn order to facilitate the securities settlement process, securities amounting to AUD 35.0 Mn were pledged by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to Euroclear for a credit facility of USD 30.0 Mn until January 2017. At present, pledged securities held with Euroclear Bank amount to USD 3.0 Mn. The pledged securities are held in a separate account at Euroclear Bank.\n\n2022Financial Assets at FVOCI\n\n2021Financial Assets at FVOCIRs. 000Rs. 000AssetsSecurities Lending - - Securities Pledged with Euroclear1,090,124 2,830,756 Securities Pledged with Federal Reserve Bank - -\n\nCarrying Amount of Assets1,090,124 2,830,756"

DOMESTIC OPERATIONS\n\n6.1 Functions of DOD\n\n6.2 Implementation of Monetary Policy\n\n6.2.1 Open Market Operations (OMOs)\n\nDOD conducts OMOs in order to maintain the Average Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR), which is the operating target of the current Flexible Inflation Targeting framework, at desired levels with less volatility in line with the prevailing monetary policy stance. AWCMR, which recorded an upward adjustment in 2022 remained stagnant at the upper bound of the Standing Rate Corridor (SRC). Call money market activities remained low since April 2022 due to increased uncertainty in the markets, particularly on account of the speculation on fiscal sector developments.\n\n(a) Estimating Money Market Liquidity\n\nDOD estimates domestic money market liquidity on a daily basis based on a number of factors. This estimation is used to address liquidity needs of the market participants through appropriate market operations in consistence with the monetary policy stance of the Central Bank.

DOD provides inputs on money market developments and liquidity estimations on domestic money market to the MOC in the process of implementing the monetary policy stance adopted by the Monetary Board. Accordingly, upon reviewing the effects on rupee market liquidity due to developments in the domestic money market and the foreign exchange markets on a daily basis, DOD proposes actions for the consideration of the MOC in managing money market liquidity and short term interest rates. MOC considers the estimated liquidity conditions, desired level of the operating target, liquidity distribution among money market participants, and need for devising appropriate market signals, among others, and thereby decides on appropriate actions to be implemented. During 2022, DOD conducted monetary operations to address asymmetric liquidity distribution in the domestic money market and to reduce liquidity stress among certain PIs.\n\n(c) Conducting Auctions\n\nIn 2022, DOD conducted auctions under OMOs to absorb and inject liquidity from and to the money market on a need basis in support of overall liquidity management operations. The following auctions were conducted in 2022, which were instrumental in minimising undue pressures in the domestic money market (Table II-7):"

The following auctions were conducted in 2022, which were instrumental in minimising undue pressures in the domestic money market (Table II-7):\n\nDuring early 2022, overnight and short term repo auctions were conducted to absorb excess liquidity from the domestic money market. Accordingly, overnight repo auctions were conducted to absorb liquidity on an overnight basis, while short term repo auctions were conducted to absorb liquidity for a period up to one week on the basis of same day settlement.\n\n(ii) Reverse Repurchase (Reverse Repo) Auctions\n\nLong term reverse repo auctions were also conducted in 2022 to inject liquidity to the domestic money market to reduce the liquidity stress among certain banks. Such long term reverse repo auctions were conducted by DOD, with the settlement on the next business day, in order to inject liquidity to address persistent liquidity needs of the market.\n\n(iii) Outright Transactions\n\nDuring 2022, outright sales of Treasury bill auctions were conducted by DOD to absorb liquidity injected through the primary purchase of Treasury bills by the Central Bank on a permanent basis from the money market. Further, attempts were made to conduct outright purchase of Treasury bill auctions towards end 2022 to inject permanent liquidity to the market though such auctions were not successful.

However, with effect from the close of business on 03 November 2022, the Bank rate was linked to the Average Weighted New Deposits Rate (AWNDR) with a margin of +700 basis points so that it was adjusted based on market conditions. Further, taking into account the trends in the domestic money market, the margin of the Bank rate was reduced to +300 basis points with effect from the close of business on 02 January 2023. During 2022, no request was received by the Central Bank for soliciting emergency loans by the banking institutions, while the Central Bank has further strengthened the Emergency Loans and Advances (ELA) framework.\n\n6.3 Functions Relating to Commercial Banks, Primary Dealers and the Government\n\n6.3.1 Accounts of Financial Institutions\n\nBy offering settlement accounts to eligible participants of the Real Time Gross Settlements (RTGS) system, the Central Bank performs a vital role in the functioning of the economy through facilitating safe and efficient payments and settlements.

The economy witnessed a sharp contraction, historically high inflation, sharp increase in interest rates, headwinds in the external sector, scarcity of essential items and social and political unrest. In line with the guidelines on Strategic Assets Allocation (SAA) of the Fund, the EPF Department invested a major portion of its funds in government securities. In view of substantial volatility observed in financial markets, EPF placed greater emphasis on investing in long term government securities. Moreover, in order to capitalise on increasing short term interest rates in the backdrop\n\nof inflationary pressures which prevailed during second and third quarters, the EPF Department increased its investments in short term Treasury bills in 2022. In the backdrop of heightened volatility in the equity market, EPF took a more cautious approach to investment opportunities in the equity market. Investment opportunities in corporate debentures were limited due to adverse macroeconomic conditions, while the EPF Department was also conscious of the need to invest in corporates with better credit ratings to mitigate credit risk of the corporate debt portfolio of the Fund.\n\nAccordingly, as at end 2022, the investment portfolio of Rs.3,466.5 billion consisted of 96.9 per cent in government securities, 2.3 per cent in equity, 0.7 per cent in corporate debentures, and the remaining 0.1 per cent in reverse repurchase agreements.\n\n(d) Payment of Interest on Member Balances"

It enables the employers to submit e-Returns through the EPF website and make payments online, by linking with a participating Licensed Commercial Bank via the \u2018LankaPay Online Payment Platform (LPOPP)\u2019 or by a cheque or as a direct debit. By end 2022, Bank of Ceylon, People\u2019s Bank, Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC, Sampath Bank PLC, and Nations Trust Bank joined with the EPF Department to provide the respective facility. One of the key features of the above system is that it enables to update the member accounts within a day, upon a successful payment. Furthermore, this system enables employers to verify the accuracy of member details in the EPF database.\n\nBy end 2022, e-Return submission increased to 12,815 employers, covering approximately 90 percent of the active member accounts and approximately 91 percent of the total monthly EPF contributions. During the year, further awareness was created among employers on benefits of e-Returns while emphasising the importance of taking actions to rectify the issues with regard to discrepancies in\n\nthe member details in relation to e-Returns. This will ensure that contributions are credited to the relevant member accounts in a timely manner.\n\n(v) Re-registration of EPF Members"

As a result, an automated EPMS was developed and implemented in June 2022, in collaboration with the Information Technology Department of the Central Bank and the Sri Lanka Customs (SLC). The main objective of the EPMS is to ensure all exports of goods from the country are captured into a database and to monitor the repatriation of export proceeds as per the Rules on Repatriation of Export Proceeds into Sri Lanka. The EPMS captures export information through a web service provided by SLC and export proceeds repatriation details are submitted by ADs to the system. Accordingly, the EPMS is expected to strength the monitoring of export proceeds repatriation into the country.\n\n13.6 Enhancing Awareness on Foreign Exchange Regulations\n\nNine awareness programmes were conducted during the year for ADs and other stakeholders on the prevailing Regulations and the provisions of the FEA.

FOREIGN REMITTANCES FACILITATION\n\nThe Foreign Remittances Facilitation Department (FRFD) was established to facilitate and streamline workers\u2019 remittance inflows to the country while working towards realising the full potential of labour migration and workers\u2019 remittances. In achieving set goals, the FRFD engaged in the following activities during 2022 and early 2023 by liaising with other relevant authorities in the foreign remittance sector.\n\n14.1 Cash Based and Non-cash Based Incentives for Migrant Workers\n\na) Implemented an incentive scheme for reimbursing transaction costs borne by migrant workers up to Rs. 1,000 per transaction equivalent to Rs. 20,000 or above when remitting money to rupee accounts maintained by licensed banks and over the counter cash receipts. In this regard, FRFD held discussions with the State Bank of Pakistan, Migrant Workers Associations abroad, Exchange House Associations abroad and licensed banks in Sri Lanka prior to designing and implementing the scheme. This scheme has been in operation since 01 February 2022.\n\nb) Designed a scheme to introduce an additional duty-free allowance for migrant workers. This scheme would\n\nencourage migrant workers to send their earnings through formal channels, facilitating sustainability and medium term growth of the non-debt forex inflows to the country. The scheme was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and is expected to be implemented in the near future."

The said Bill has been further developed to capture new areas in central banking in association with such stakeholders. The Bill inter alia provides for the autonomy of the Central Bank with enhanced governance standards, an advanced Board structure to secure the objects thereof, and enhanced regulatory and supervisory powers, etc. It will replace the Monetary Law Act, No. 58 of 1949 once enacted.\n\nDuring 2022, there was a considerable increase in litigation filed against the Central Bank pursuant to the economic downturn of the country, and LD, with the assistance of the relevant departments made submissions to secure the interests of the Bank. In collaboration with law enforcement authorities of the country, LD continued to institute action against unauthorised finance companies, prohibited schemes, and instituted actions to wind up finance companies of which licenses were cancelled by the Monetary Board, with a view to safeguarding the interests of the depositors and creditors of such entities.\n\nLD actively collaborated with the other departments of the Central Bank in developing and amending subsidiary legislations issued by the Monetary Board under the statutes administered by the Central Bank, with a view to enhancing its regulatory authority and thereby, ensuring the soundness of the banking and financial sector. LD also reviewed the statutes developed outside the Central Bank by giving observations to\n\nthe provisions thereof, including the Personal Data Protection Act No. 09 of 2022 and Colombo Port City Economic Commission Act, No. 11 of 2021."

The liquidity stress testing framework assesses the resilience of the banking sector to systemic liquidity shocks.\n\nA new framework for interconnectedness and contagion analysis of the banking sector was developed with the assistance from IMF TA during the year. Interconnectedness and contagion analysis primarily focuses on the risks towards the banking system through interbank exposures and extends to assess the contagion risks emanating from the State Owned Entities and LFCs while factoring solvency and liquidity channels in the model. MSD conducted pilot interconnectedness and contagion analysis during the year.\n\n(b) Surveys, Indices and Data Collection\n\nMSD continued to conduct the Systemic Risk Survey (SRS) on a biannual basis, which is a forward looking survey that quantifies and tracks market participants\u2019 perceptions on the potential risks to financial system stability signaling any buildup of systemic vulnerabilities and perceived probability of a high impact event.

Hence,\n\nthe need to strengthen crisis preparedness and manage a financial crisis if one transpires was recognised by international agencies and the Central Bank. This requires buildup of legal, regulatory, and institutional architecture, in order to respond in a timely and effective way. As such, the World Bank highlighted the importance of the formation of a Financial Sector CMC as a forum for policy coordination. Accordingly, MSD took the initiative to develop the framework for the establishment of CMC, which will be a permanent forum to work during crisis times for effective financial crisis management and during non-crisis times to strengthen the financial crisis preparedness framework in the country.\n\n21.

REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nAgainst this backdrop, RDD continued to coordinate, facilitate, and implement various Refinance, Interest Subsidy and Credit Guarantee Schemes while providing a range of credit supplementary services during the year. These schemes were funded by the Central Bank, Government, Donor Agencies, and Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs).\n\nOn the financial inclusion front, RDD housed the National Financial Inclusion Secretariat established to coordinate, monitor, and evaluate the activities of Sri Lanka\u2019s first ever National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) launched in 2021. By the end of 2022, NFIS had achieved a significant progress with the support of key implementing agencies led by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance.\n\nThe Pilot Phase of the Domestic Agriculture Development program (DAD-PP) has been reviewed by a team of consultants from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) on behalf of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to explore the posibilities in funding the main DAD programme, which is expected to be implemented in 2024.\n\nDuring the year, several measures were taken in respect of the schemes implemented by RDD including changing applicable interest rates, extending operational periods, providing debt moratoria etc., and identifying the requirements of the market and beneficiaries, in order to provide better tailored products to the underserved segments. In doing so, RDD, considering the credit risk borne by the PFIs, continued to share the credit risk through the guarantee schemes against loans granted to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)."

Accordingly, the model based and indicator based forecasts were produced using relevant inputs from various sources. These forecasts were detailed and discussed at regular monetary policy cycles and submitted to the Monetary Board (MB) to facilitate policy decision making.\n\n30.1.1 Forecasting Near Term Inflation\n\nThe latest price trends and expected price movements associated with market developments and econometric techniques were used to forecast near term inflation based on both the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) and National Consumer Price Index (NCPI). In line with continuous efforts to improve inflation forecasting, STD explored new variables and data sources that reflected both supply and demand side impact on inflation and novel forecasting models using time series and machine learning techniques.\n\n30.1.2 Forecasting Near Term GDP\n\nNear term GDP growth forecasts were prepared on a quarterly basis using both indicator and model based techniques. Primary and secondary leading economic indicators and survey findings related to economic activities were combined with expert judgments in indicator based forecasting, while model based forecasts were prepared using econometrics techniques.\n\n30.2 Collecting Data and Compiling Indices to Provide Timely Information for Data Driven Decision Making Process"

Unreasonable length of time taken to complete the services offered by the staff,\n\n2. Delays and long duration taken to credit funds to relevant local accounts when executed from overseas,\n\n3. Bank staff misinterpreting the CBSL /FIU circulars and misinforming the customers.\n\nMuch of these complaints were concentrated on the conduct of branches at regional and outstations.\n\nAccordingly, your attention is drawn to streamline the processes of attracting remittances by regional and outstation branches.\n\nYours faithfully(Mrs.) E H MohottyDirectorFinancial Intelligence UnitCc: Director, Bank Supervision Department, Central Bank of Sri Lanka Compliance Officers of Licensed Commercial Banks & Licensed Specialised Banks\n\nCircular: 04/2022 November 21, 2022\n\nRef: 037/05/003/0005/022\n\nTo: All General Managers/Chief Executive Officers of Financial Institutions\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nAuthenticating customer identification details through the Department of Immigration and Emigration\n\nThe Department of Immigration and Emigration has agreed to provide the service of authenticating customer identification details as required by the Financial Institutions Customer Due Diligence Rules, No. 1 of 2016."

SLIPS was introduced by the CBSL in 1993 as an off-line Interbank Payment System. In 2002, the CBSL divested the clearing operations of Cheques and SLIPS to LCPL. The objectives of the SLIPS are to establish a uniform and common electronic retail payment system and to promote payment system safety and efficiency while promoting cooperation among all SLIPS participants in the evolution of the country\u2019s retail payment systems. SLIPS was upgraded to an on-line Interbank Payment System by LCPL in September 2010 to facilitate settlement of transactions on the same business day.\n\nPart III\n\nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2022\n\nAdministrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year\n\nPart III - 55\n\nA.
