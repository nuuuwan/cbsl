Domestic inflation is affected by demand side factors, supply side factors, and the economic agent\u2019s expectations on the future course of inflation. Demand side factors are typically the outcomes of a growing economy, public expectations of future price movements, and macroeconomic policies (i.e., monetary policy and fiscal policy) aimed at influencing the aggregate demand conditions of the economy, whereas supply side factors could be the outcomes of either the supply side policies of the Government or some exogenous circumstances, such as natural disasters, global events, etc. As the people of Sri Lanka consume a considerable share of imported items, the country\u2019s inflation is also affected by the movements in global commodity prices. In addition, exchange rate movements affect inflation. For instance, a depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against the US dollar (since most imports are valued in US dollar terms) will increase the price of imports in domestic currency terms.\n\nWhat is Disinflation?"

However, the long term gains for the economy on account of reduced distortions due to high inflation outweigh the short term costs.

Figure B 1.4 depicts inflation projections of selected countries as per their most recent monetary policy reports. The figure shows that in many countries, inflation increased substantially in 2022, beyond the central banks' inflation targets. However, these countries are expecting a sharp disinflation in 2023, as is the case with Sri Lanka, in a synchronous manner.\n\nThe Role of Inflation Expectations and Inflation Forecasts\n\nThe disinflation process of the country is also expected to be reinforced by well-anchored inflation expectations. Inflation expectations reflect the rate at which the stakeholders in an economy expect prices to change in the future. Inflation expectations matter because actual inflation depends, in part, on what the public expects it to be, as expectations could influence spending, borrowing and investment decisions today. Therefore, the disinflation process involves a deliberate course of action by a central bank to change the prevailing expectations of economic agents, if such expectations are higher than the medium term inflation target. In Sri Lanka, inflation expectations destabilised to some extent following the high inflation episode in 2022. However,"

This has been mainly due to the lack of commitment to meeting the conditionalities attached to such programmes, especially those related to structural reforms, which required painful macroeconomic adjustments and unpopular policies that were aimed at long term welfare enhancements. Therefore, it is imperative that Sri Lanka internalises these reforms in its policy formulation and implements the major areas of reforms in the current IMF programme as well as reforms beyond the programme to help the economy transform into greater stability and a higher growth path at the earliest while circumventing the need for repeated access to IMF bailouts and several rounds of debt restructuring in the future.\n\nReference\n\n1.

In response\n\nto these failures, the Federal Reserve of the US\n\nand the US government agencies announced\n\na series of measures to ensure the availability\n\nof liquidity to banks in financial distress and to\n\nhonour deposits of failed banks. Apart from the\n\nUS banking sector, Credit Suisse (CS), a global\n\ninvestment bank and financial services firm based\n\nin Switzerland, showed signs of financial distress in\n\nMarch 2023. However, its collapse was averted by\n\nan emergency loan facility provided by the Swiss\n\nNational Bank to shore up finances. CS was later\n\ntaken over by UBS, the largest banking institution\n\nin Switzerland, a deal which was fast tracked by the\n\nSwiss National Bank and the Swiss government.\n\nMoreover, the ongoing banking crisis has triggered\n\nmarket panic in advanced economies and resulted\n\nin significant losses in the share values of the US\n\nand European banking sectors. Meanwhile, the US\n\nFederal Reserve, the Bank of Canada, BoE, the\n\nBank of Japan, ECB, and the Swiss National Bank\n\nannounced a collaborative action later in March\n\n2023, to enhance the provision of liquidity via the\n\nstanding US dollar liquidity swap line arrangements\n\nto stem liquidity concerns in the global financial\n\nsystem and ensure smooth cross border settlements.\n\nNonetheless, the current distress in global banking\n\ninstitutions and the consequent contagion effects"

Hence, several provisions of the MLA, amidst economic developments and the evolution of central banking in general, necessitated reassessment and amendments in line with the international best practices. This paved the way for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act (CBA) to be drafted to include provisions strengthening the Central Bank independence, enhancing transparency and accountability and strengthening the monetary policy framework to ensure sustained price stability in Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, the CBA is also expected to strengthen the financial sector and macroprudential oversight and improve the governance of the Central Bank. The amendments to the MLA and subsequent CBA are expected to be in line with international best practices in central banking and address shortcomings of the MLA as well.\n\nBOX 3Highlights of 'the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act'\n\nKey Highlights of the Central Bank Act\n\nThe CBA bears several important amendments compared to the MLA, in several areas, mainly the objectives of the Central Bank and monetary policy framework, its governance and organisational structure recognising the Central Bank as the macroprudential authority, and the Central Bank\u2019s accountability to the Parliament, the Government, and the public.\n\nDomestic Price Stability as the Primary Objective"

In the meantime, the CBA endorses more accountability and transparency of the Central Bank making it answerable to the legislature and the public. The primarily mandated objectives of price stability and increased accountability of the Central Bank would protect the country from disruptive effects of high and volatile inflation, and associated sharp movements in interest rates, thus fostering sustainable long term economic growth.\n\nwiden moderately in 2023 with a projected increase\n\nin merchandise imports triggered by the gradual\n\nnormalisation of economic activity and possible\n\nrelaxation of some trade restrictions going forward.\n\nThe forecast of the trade deficit for 2023 could\n\nalso be affected by a possible economic downturn\n\nin the United Kingdom, the European Union, and\n\nthe United States, possibly dampening external\n\ndemand. In addition, any further escalation of the\n\nRussia-Ukraine war could impact global supply\n\nchains, thereby increasing import expenditure. The\n\nservices account surplus is likely to increase in\n\n2023 with the projected increase in earnings from\n\ntourism as well as the envisaged improvement\n\nin competitiveness of other services exports with\n\nthe gradual normalisation of domestic economic\n\nactivity and expected reduction in domestic inflation\n\nduring the second half of 2023.

The economic crisis initially caused supply disruptions in the forms of severe shortages of consumer\n\ngoods, energy sources including fuel and electricity, and inputs for various industries, mainly on account of\n\nthe sharp depletion of foreign exchange liquidity in the market leading to a significant increase in prices. This\n\nsituation compelled both the Central Bank and Government to introduce painful but essential policy measures,\n\nsuch as unprecedented adjustments to policy interest rates to curtail inflationary pressures and prioritisation\n\nof essential imports to minimise foreign exchange outflows, to prevent further worsening of the crisis. These\n\nmeasures contributed to contain demand pressures, minimise supply side disruptions, and improve availability\n\nof essential imports including fuel and material for industries, thereby gradually stabilising the economy.\n\nReflecting the impact of economic stresses, all three major economic activities, namely, Industry, Services\n\nand Agriculture, contracted during the year 2022.

The\n\nimpact of fertiliser shortages on immature rubber\n\nplantations during 2022 was significant, causing\n\nstunted tree growth that causes delays in the\n\ntapping stage of plantations and reduces land\n\nproductivity in the period ahead. Furthermore,\n\nthe scarcity of agrochemicals resulted in severe\n\npropagation of the Pestalotiopsis disease in rubber\n\nplantations during the year, affecting around\n\n40,000 hectares of rubber plantations, resulting\n\nin a decline in yield ranging from 0-10 per cent\n\nin affected rubber plantations. Accordingly, total\n\nrubber production decreased by 7.8 per cent\n\nto 70.9 million kilogrammes, year-on-year,\n\nin 2022. Among major categories of rubber\n\nproduction, sheet rubber production accounted for\n\n49.0 per cent of the total rubber production with a\n\ncontraction of 9.6 per cent, while production of other\n\ncategories of rubber recorded a decline of 11.7 per\n\ncent during the year, compared to 2021. However,\n\ncrepe rubber production recorded a growth of 3.9\n\nper cent during 2022. Despite the notable increase\n\nin local rubber prices in 2022, productivity and\n\ntapping limitations in the rubber sector prevented\n\nplausible improvements in production. Meanwhile,\n\nthe average yield of rubber reduced by 2.1 per cent,\n\nyear-on-year, to 665 kilogrammes per hectare in\n\n2022 due to the reduction in tapping days. The cost\n\nof production of rubber was on the rise and recorded\n\nat Rs. 288.00 per kilogramme by end of 2022,\n\nregistering an increase of 30.3 per cent from the\n\nprevious year.

In contrast, the performance of the\n\nmanufacture of beverages subsector recorded a\n\nnotable expansion among all the other subsectors\n\nof the IIP during the year, on account of the growth\n\nin the production of arrack, beer, and soft drinks.\n\nAccordingly, the beverage manufacturing activities\n\nrecorded a year-on-year growth of 20.3 per cent in\n\n2022, over the year-on-year growth of 9.8 per cent\n\nin 2021. Despite the overall positive performance\n\nof the beverage manufacturing activities in 2022, a\n\nslight moderation in the performance of the sector\n\nwas observed during the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nThe manufacturing of wearing apparel,\n\nwhich is the second largest subsector in the\n\nIIP, recorded a favourable recovery in 2022,\n\nlargely supported by the recovery in global\n\nsupply chains, whereas the textiles subsector\n\nwitnessed a contraction. Accordingly, the\n\nmanufacturing of wearing apparel subsector\n\nregistered a year-on-year growth of 5.3 per\n\ncent in 2022, compared to the notable growth of\n\n17.5 per cent registered in 2021. The adverse\n\nimplications of import restrictions, logistics issues,\n\nand power outages on the wearing apparel sector\n\nwere largely offset by several policy decisions\n\ninitiated by the Government. These included\n\nallowing exporters to buy fuel directly from the\n\nCeylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) using US\n\ndollars and providing tariff concessions for several\n\nraw material imports during the period under review.\n\nAdditionally, the depreciation of exchange rate and\n\nthe global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic,"

Some\n\nimprovements could be witnessed towards the latter part of 2022 in the provisioning of economic services\n\nwith the implementation of both supply and demand management strategies, including the introduction of\n\ncost reflective pricing in several state-owned business enterprises, among others. However, heightened\n\nvulnerabilities in the provisioning of economic and social infrastructure services to economic headwinds\n\nunderscored the need for expeditious implementation of long overdue structural reforms in the public\n\nsector. Significant power outages and fuel shortages, particularly during mid-2022, caused unprecedented\n\ndisruptions to socio-economic activities, resulting in a major setback to overall economic activity during 2022.\n\nHowever, the severity of the energy crisis subsided in the second half of the year amidst increased contribution\n\nof hydropower generation, and measures introduced to address supply and demand imbalances, including\n\nthe introduction of a QR code system for fuel supply, securing of foreign financial assistance to import\n\ncooking gas, rolling out cost reflective revisions to prices of fuel products and electricity after long overdue\n\nprice adjustments. Accordingly, domestic retail prices of petroleum products were revised in multiple rounds\n\nin 2022, based on a pricing formula from May 2022 reflecting the movements of global energy prices, among\n\nothers. Electricity tariffs were revised upward in August 2022 over eight years of hiatus, followed by another\n\nrevision in February 2023, pursuant to the establishment of a semi annual tariff revision mechanism from\n\n2023 onwards.

Accordingly,\n\ndomestic prices of key petroleum products sold by\n\nCPC were revised upward in March, April, May,\n\nJune, and November of 2022, and in February 2023\n\nin keeping with the escalation of global prices of\n\npetroleum products. Petroleum prices were revised\n\ndownward on several occasions, in July, August,\n\nOctober and December of 2022, and in January\n\nand March 2023, following the price declines in\n\nglobal markets. Further, the retail price of kerosene\n\nwas notably adjusted upward by CPC towards\n\nthe end of August 2022, to curb the substantial\n\nlosses incurred by CPC in selling kerosene at a\n\nsignificantly subsidised rate. Following the price\n\nrevisions of CPC, Lanka IOC PLC (LIOC) revised\n\ndomestic prices of petroleum products upward in\n\neleven rounds and downward in eight rounds to\n\nalign its prices with those of CPC. Meanwhile,\n\nthe Government imposed an Excise Duty of\n\nRs. 25.00 per litre on imports of key refined\n\npetroleum products with effect from 01 January\n\n2023 to meet the debt servicing obligations of\n\nthe foreign currency debt stock of CPC, which\n\nwas transferred to the Government debt stock in\n\nDecember 2022. Accordingly, the Excise (Special\n\nProvisions) Duty on octane 92 and octane 95\n\npetrol increased to Rs. 52.00 per litre, while the\n\nduty applicable for super diesel and auto diesel\n\nincreased to Rs. 38.00 and Rs. 31.00 per litre,\n\nrespectively, with effect from 01 January 2023,\n\nthereby raising the prices of domestic petroleum\n\nproducts.\n\nFigure 3.2Trends in Global Crude Oil Prices\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nBrentWTIBrent Average 2019Brent Average 2020Brent Average 2021\n\nBrent Average 2023 (As at 31 March)\n\nBrent Average 2022Brent Average 2022 H2Brent Average 2022 H1\n\n64.04\n\n43.35\n\n70.80\n\n105.12\n\n93.39\n\n82.24\n\n99.06\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\nJan-19\n\nApr-19"

However, the progress towards alleviating malnutrition has moderated over the last few decades. According to the latest Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) - 2016, prevalence of wasting in children under five years remained at 15.1 per cent, reaching the emergency threshold level of wasting among children. Also, the prevalence of wasting among children under five years showed no significant progress in the survey rounds since 1995/96 to the 2016 period. According to the World Bank statistics, Sri Lanka ranked the second worst affected country in the South Asian region in terms of wasting among children under five years.

The Nuwara Eliya District had the highest percentage of stunted children, with a reported percentage of 22.8 per cent, while the Colombo District had the lowest percentage of stunted children of 5.1 per cent. Further, the Nuwara Eliya District reported the highest percentage of underweight children under the age of five, at 23.9 per cent, while the Colombo District had the lowest percentage of underweight children at 9.8 per cent. It is apparent that nutrition anomalies in the country have been persisted despite government intervention efforts, and these inequalities are likely to worsen during economic crises unless addressed cohesively.\n\nThe Government\u2019s Responses\n\nPolicy Agenda to Combat Child Malnutrition\n\nFigure B 5.2District Level Worsening Status of Child Malnutrition\n\nSource: Family Health Bureau, Ministry of Health\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n%\n\nStunting\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n%\n\nUnderweight\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nColomboGampahaKalutaraAnuradhapuraPolonnaruwaBadullaMonaragalaGalleMataraHambantotaKandyMataleNuwara EliyaKegalleRatnapuraKurunagalaPuttalamAmparaKalmunaiBatticaloaTrincomaleeJaffnaKillinochchiMullaitivueVavuniyaMannarSri Lanka\n\n%\n\nWasting\n\n202020212022\n\n3\n\nECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n129"

Nevertheless, the rate of increase\n\nof price levels moderated towards the end of the year following the tight monetary policy stance pursued\n\nby the Central Bank and easing of supply conditions. The decline in agriculture production caused by\n\nthe limited availability and high prices of inputs, and interruptions to the distribution network due to fuel\n\nshortages led the prices of domestically produced food items to increase substantially. Meanwhile, the\n\nincrease in global commodity prices, high freight charges and most notably, the sharp depreciation\n\nof the Sri Lanka rupee contributed to considerable upshifts in the prices of both imported Food and\n\nNon-food items exerting significant upward pressure on the general price level. Moreover, the cost reflective\n\nrevisions to administered prices and upward revisions to value added tax (VAT) and the introduction\n\nof the social security contribution levy (SSCL) also augmented the price increases in both Food and\n\nNon-food categories.

Rebasing of CPIs at regular intervals in line with international standards and best practices is essential to reflect contemporary consumer spending patterns in a more accurate manner. Rebasing leads to upgrades of main features of the CPIs especially the weight structure, which indicates the prominence or the representativeness of goods and services in the basket of goods and services. Further, the composition of the basket would also get revised with addition of new items and removal of existing items based on the significance of latest consumption patterns.\n\nThe DCS released rebased CPIs (2021=100), i.e., National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) and Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) from February 2023. The CCPI which was introduced with the base year of 1952 was rebased four times resulting CCPI series with the base years, 1952, 2002, 2006/07, 2013 and 2021, while for the NCPI, 2021 is the second series after its first series with the base year 2013. The methodology of the index calculation was updated with the rebasing, where CPIs (2021=100) are now calculated in two stages. In the initial stage, elementary indices are compiled, while higher level indices are compiled at the second stage.

It is noteworthy that Housing, Water, Electricity and Other Fuels, Food and Non Alcoholic Beverages, and Transport sub-categories continued to remain as the topmost categories in terms of their expenditure value with the rebasing of both the CCPI and NCPI.\n\nIn terms of both the CPIs the index overlapping period is between January 2022 and December 2022. Accordingly, the comparison of month-on-month percentage changes of both the CPIs with their current and previous base periods are shown in Figures B 6.3 and B 6.4. As per these figures, the variations between\n\nthe base years are largely minimal owing to the slight differences in the weight structure and the composition of the basket of goods and services under the two bases. Nevertheless, it is imperative to rebase CPIs on the specific time intervals to ensure that the prevailing consumption patterns are reflected accurately as CPIs plays a crucial role in the economic decision making processes of various economic agencies.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
