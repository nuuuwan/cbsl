During the first part of the year, food and energy crises in the global economy was threatening the macroeconomic stability by way of sharply widening trade and current account deficits, raising inflation to the highest ever levels since 1980s and exerting pressures on fiscal balances due to tax exemptions arising from duty waivers granted in order to minimise the impact of high food and energy prices on domestic cost of living coupled with high defence expenditure and the cost of rehabilitation, resettlement and reconstruction of the Eastern Province. Towards the latter part of the year, the second wave of the global financial crisis, which originated from the sub-prime mortgage issue in the United States, turned into an unprecedented global financial turmoil from September 2008 onwards, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Inc., which was a highly reputed major financial institution in the United States. The global financial turmoil triggered a reversal of capital flows from emerging market economies for safety, resulting in an outflow of approximately US dollars 120 billion from the Asian region within a short period towards end 2008. Sri Lanka also had to cope up with its share of sudden withdrawals of foreign capital by supplying almost 50 per cent of its external official reserves, which had been prudently accumulated to the highest ever level of US dollars 3.56 billion by end July 2008. Consequently, the accumulated balance of payments\n\n2\n\nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2008\n\neconomic, price and financial system stability, outlook and policies\n\n1\n\nsurplus of US dollars 515 million by end July 2008 turned into a deficit of US dollars 1.2 billion by the end of 2008."

This was more than sufficient to finance the higher current account deficit, generating a surplus by end September 2008.\n\nChart 1.2Savings and Investment\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n20042005200620072008\n\nPercentage of GDP\n\nGross InvestmentGross Domestic Savings\n\nChart 1.3\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n3500\n\n20042005200620072008\n\nUS $ million\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nUS $ / barrel\n\nValue Avg Price - Right Axis\n\nValue of Petroleum Imports and Average\n\nPrice of Crude Oil Imports\n\n7\n\nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2008\n\neconomic, price and financial system stability, outlook and policies\n\n1"

The unexpected decline in prices had a favourable impact on import expenditure in the last quarter. Petroleum imports, which grew by 61.4 per cent during the first three quarters, declined by 25.6 per cent in the fourth quarter. Reduction in expenditure on other imports, along with petroleum, led imports to decelerate very rapidly, to record a flat growth in the last quarter. As a result, imports grew by 24.0 per cent in 2008. All major categories of imports increased reflecting a broad based expansion. The higher growth of expenditure on imports in 2008 relative to the lower growth in exports contributed to the substantial expansion in the trade deficit in 2008. The overall trade deficit widened by 60.6 per cent to US dollars 5.9 billion in 2008 from US dollars 3.7 billion in 2007. As a percentage of GDP, the trade deficit deteriorated to 14.4 per cent in 2008 from 11.3 per cent in 2007.\n\nIn the service sector, the strong performance of transportation, telecommunication, computer and information services, construction and insurance services was partially offset by the slowdown in travel and other business services. The tourism industry remained sluggish during 2008. At the beginning of the year, arrivals were mainly affected by the travel advisories issued by some key\n\ntourist generating countries. However, as the year progressed, arrivals declined further with the onset of the global recession."

Workers\u2019 remittances grew at a higher rate in 2008, and reached US dollars 2,918 million compared to US dollars 2,502 million in 2007. This increase was attributable mainly to an increase in the number of migrant workers leaving for foreign employment, increase in the average wages of migrants in the Middle Eastern region due to the rise in income level of oil producing countries and increased migration to high wage countries. The current account deficit more than doubled to US dollars 3,775 million in 2008 from US dollars 1,401 million in 2007 due to increased trade deficit led by unprecedentedly high import expenditure.

The government permitted foreigners to invest up to a maximum of 10 per cent of the value of outstanding Treasury bills effective from May 2008 as a part of further liberalisation of the capital account. As a result, outstanding Treasury bills and bonds investments by foreigners reached its peak level of US dollars 641 million by September 2008. However, these investments collapsed with the deepening of the global financial crisis and the inflows recorded till the end of September 2008, suddenly reversed and by end 2008, turned into a net outflow of US dollars 213 million. This was due to the withdrawal of US dollars 430 million in the last quarter as investors shifted funds rapidly on concerns of safety and liquidity amidst the global credit crunch. In order to meet the sudden foreign exchange requirement arising from the liquidation of these investments and to create confidence among the investors, the Central Bank created a Sinking Fund, which facilitated the withdrawal of funds by foreign investors without exerting any undue pressure on the domestic foreign exchange market.\n\nForeign capital to the private sector and public corporations increased in 2008. Long-term borrowings by the private sector enterprises, particularly in power and energy, telecommunications and finance sectors, increased as the domestic interest rates were relatively high in 2008.

The relatively better fiscal performance experienced during the first nine months of 2008 changed significantly during the last quarter of the year and resulted in deviations in the annual outcome of some key fiscal aggregates. During the first nine month period of the year, total revenue continued to increase at a relatively high rate of 22 per cent while total expenditure and net lending increased by 20 per cent. The financing mix between domestic and foreign sources was fairly good and the government continued to repay the outstanding debt to the Central Bank until September 2008.\n\nChart 1.5Government Revenue, Expenditure\n\nand Budget Deficit\n\nExpenditureRevenueOverall Deficit-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n20042005200620072008\n\nPercentage of GDP\n\n11\n\nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2008\n\neconomic, price and financial system stability, outlook and policies\n\n1\n\nfinancial conditions. This performance was achieved through the continuation of the mega infrastructure development projects and implementation of a number of provincial and rural infrastructure development activities aiming at empowering the rural masses. However, the performance of the public investment programme was considerably below the expectations mainly due to the lower inflow of foreign commercial financing and the shortfall in the government revenue, which necessitated the prioritisation of the projects and the releasing of funds. As a combined outcome of these developments, the overall budget deficit in 2008 amounted to 7.7 per cent of GDP, same as in the previous year, compared to the original target of 7.0 per cent."

The significant deceleration in inflation confirms that the Central Bank\u2019s strategy of focusing more on quantitative targets to contain market liquidity and allowing the market interest rates to adjust at a faster pace has been more effective in a high inflationary environment. Inflation further decelerated during the first quarter of 2009, at a faster rate than expected, and reached single digit levels by end February. Since inflation is stabilising at a more manageable level, the Central Bank intends to revert to conducting the monetary policy operations within the interest rate corridor formed by its policy rates in 2009 and maintain interest rates stable around a level consistent with the reserve money targets."

In the case of Sri Lanka, because of the fact that the capital account has not been fully liberalised and that many local banks did not trade in complex financial instruments, the direct impact of the global financial crisis on the country\u2019s financial sector was minimal. However, with the intensification of the crisis that has spilled into the real sector of the economy, the effects of the turmoil are being felt strongly by the country.\n\nDue to the global financial crisis, many foreign investors who have invested in developing markets repatriated their short-term investments back to their countries for meeting rising liquidity requirements. Sri Lanka has not been an exception. With the increased outflow of foreign exchange and coupled with declined inflows due to a lower demand for exports, there was a pressure on the exchange rate to depreciate amidst virtual drying up of credit lines. To ensure adequate US dollar liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market, the Central Bank, while allowing limited flexibility in the exchange rate, supplied US dollars to the market, to ensure stability in the domestic foreign exchange market. With the supply of US dollars to the domestic market, the rupee liquidity however suffered continuous shortfalls, resulting in rupee borrowing costs remaining at higher levels. To overcome the liquidity shortfalls, the Central Bank released the liquidity absorbed through foreign exchange operations by reducing the Statutory Reserve Ratio in three steps by 3 per centage points"

The government has unveiled a stimulus package to boost ailing sectors of the economy requiring additional financing. At the same time the government need to make additional spending particularly with the resettlement, rehabilitation and reconstruction work in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. The stortage of short-term foreign finacing and challenging task of rolling over of existing foreign debt pose downside risks to the budgetory position of the government.

With the drying up of financial flows to the private sector, it became imperative for the governments to implement fiscal stimulus to support economic activities and ensure financial stability.\n\n1.4 Medium Term Macroeconomic\n\nOutlook, Challenges and Policies\n\nThe Sri Lankan economy is projected to grow at a lower rate in 2009 and then recover its growth momentum in 2010 with expected recovery in\n\n20\n\nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2008\n\neconomic, price and financial system stability, outlook and policies\n\n1"

In 2009, allocations have been provided for the development activities in the NP through different Ministries. These development activities include Gama Neguma (village reawakening) project, construction of the Mannar Bridge, Kankesanthurai Port Development project and Maga Neguma project. However, with the significant progress that has been made in the liberation of the NP, the government has decided to accelerate the development programme in the NP.\n\nIn line with this, the government, in its Budget 2009, has announced a comprehensive programme called \u2018Vadakkin Wasantham\u2019 (Florishing North) covering all districts in the province. Accordingly, this programme primarily aims at resettlement of people and rehabilitation and reconstruction of economic infrastructure to restore livelihoods and basic needs such as water supply, sanitation, electricity, health and education facilities etc. and the creation of income\n\n1The NP consists of two distinct geographic areas known as (1) Jaffna peninsula where the majority of the NP population lives, and (2) Vanni, which is made up of the remaining four districts; Kilinochchi, Mannar, Mullaitivu and Vavuniya.\n\n2The main products of the NP, particularly in Jaffna, include sea products, red onion, mangoes, grapes and tobacco.\n\n22\n\nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2008\n\neconomic, price and financial system stability, outlook and policies\n\n1"

As an initial step, a new division, called \u2018Northern Regional Development Division\u2019, has already been established within the MNB. Accordingly, planning and preparation of progammes, implementation, coordination, monitoring, progress review and follow-up action have been entrusted to this division. A multi-sectoral integrated development process, covering social and economic infrastructure, general services and cultural aspects, will be adopted under this programme to address the total development of the NP. The institutional impediments to commence productive activities in all sectors of the NP will also be addressed gradually. The coordination of the development activities with line Ministries and development partners will also be carried out by MNB.

Meanwhile, as the public service is already overstaffed and absorbs a substantial part of budgetary allocation, it is imperative that further recruitment be limited by the government assessing the essential cadre requirement in the public sector."

This is particularly manifested in the medium-term plans to reduce the overall budget deficit to a sustainable level to meet the targets in the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act (FMRA) through enhancing the revenue by improving tax administration and expanding the tax base, containing recurrent expenditure, and maintaining a relatively high level of public investment. Meanwhile, the debt management policy also has to be directed towards improving domestic debt market activities, facing the challenge of accessing foreign concessional financing in the future being an emerging middle income country, and finding alternative financing sources, such as Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to reduce the burden on the government budget. In this context, the timely and dedicated implementation of the planned fiscal consolidation framework is essential to achieve the anticipated targets and thereby to avoid adverse\n\nramifications that high fiscal deficits would have on the country\u2019s overall macroeconomic management, including monetary management, and the realisation of anticipated high and sustainable economic growth in the medium term."

The Agriculture sector recorded a signi\ufb01 cant growth of 8.5 per cent, mainly due to the recovery in tea and paddy production with the bumper harvest during the Yala season. The Industry sector grew by 6.2 per cent with the largest sub-sector, manufacturing, expanding by 4.8 per cent. The Services sector also expanded by 6.3 per cent with the wholesale and retail trade sub-sector which constitutes the highest share, increasing by 5.6 per cent during the \ufb01 rst nine months of 2008.\n\nThe economy slowed down during the fourth quarter; with the Agriculture sector decelerating to 4.0 per cent particularly due to the contraction in tea and minor export crops.

The contraction in factor income receipts by 93.8 per cent together with the deceleration in factor income payments by 14.4 per cent resulted in net factor income contracting by a signi\ufb01 cant 153.6 per cent during 2008 exerting a negative impact on GNP. This was particularly due to the decline in interest income during 2008 with the unfavourable reduction of interest rates in the global economy.\n\nIn terms of current market prices, GDP increased by 23.2 per cent during 2008 to Rs. 4,411 billion from Rs. 3,579 billion in 2007. This was the result of real expansion in economic activities together with an increase in price levels in the overall economy as indicated by an increase in the GDP de\ufb02 ator by 16.3 per cent, compared to the 14.0 per cent increase in 2007.\n\nThe mid-year population increased by 1.0 per cent to 20,217,000 during 2008 and GDP per capita income increased by 22.0 per cent to Rs. 218,161.

Nevertheless, the production in the second half of the year was on a continuous increasing path, which led to the growth of 4.6 per cent, when compared to the corresponding period of the previous year.\n\nThe prices of coconut and coconut-based products including coconut oil and desiccated coconuts (DC) at the Colombo Auction increased substantially during the \ufb01 rst half of 2008, but started to decline in the second half of the year. The higher price for coconut and coconut-based products in the \ufb01 rst half was attributable to the combined effect of high domestic demand with supply shortage, shortages of supply in international markets and the increase in world demand for coconut oil for bio-fuel production. However, increased production and decline of petroleum prices followed by reduced demand for bio-fuel, and the changes introduced in the duty structure of imported edible oils, contributed to the decline of prices of coconut and coconut-based products towards the end of the year."

A pre-requisite for a developed dairy sector is the use of high bred milch cows, availability of nutritious cattle fodder and an effective markeing system for the sale of its output.\n\nAlthough the consumption of dairy products has risen substantially with the increase in incomes, the domestic dairy industry had not grown in tandem with the rising demand. In general, about less than a quarter of the total milk requirements has been domestically sourced. On account of the paucity of widespread refrigeratio services, all imports of milk products have principally been in the form of dried milk powder.\n\nSome recent surveys have identi\ufb01 ed the following constraints to dairy sector development in the country:\n\n\u2022 Low milk yield of milch cows.\n\n\u2022 Uneconomical farm gate price of milk, compared to high cost of production."

However, the commodity price in\ufb02 ation experienced in 2007 saw a rapid rise in the prices of imported milk powder in the domestic markets and provided a window of opportunity for dairy development making the domestic dairy industry competitive in terms of new prices.

In allocating such funds, the FC is required to take into account the population of each province, per capita income of each province, social and economic disparities, and differences in the per capita income of provinces.\n\nThe FC was in need of a measure that enables it to gain a comprehensive insight into the level of socio-economic progress at provincial level, and make rankings among provinces in terms of socio-economic progress. To facilitate this a measure of relative prosperity of provinces was necessary.\n\nIn broad terms, the well-being of people and socio-economic infrastructure facilities that are available for the people, are key components for measuring prosperity of a province or its people. Recognizing this need of measuring comparative provincial standings in relation to some broad measures of prosperity, the CBSL in consultation with the FC developed the Prosperity Index for Sri Lanka.\n\nAfter having several rounds of discussions and consultations with expert groups and taking into consideration the internationally accepted norms in constructing indices of this nature, the CBSL constructed the Prosperity Index for Sri Lanka incorporating 20 variables. Those variables represent various facets of the lives of the people and were chosen on the basis of availability of data timely and consistently.\n\nTable B 4.1The Structure of SLPI\n\nVariableSub-Indices and their contribution to SLPI"

The increased growth in GDE is attributed to the increase in price levels by 18.2 per cent and growth in real GDE of 7.1 per cent during 2008 as against the price level increase of 14.9 per cent and the real GDE growth of 5.4 per cent during 2007.

The share of private sector and public sector investment was 15 per cent and 5 per cent in 2008. A decline in export of goods and services was witnessed in 2008 with the share of exports of goods declining from 17 per cent to 14 per cent and export of services remaining at 4 per cent.\n\nSavings\n\nDuring 2008, both domestic savings and national savings contracted particularly due to the prevalence of high food and oil prices in the international markets during the \ufb01 rst nine months of the year. This led to an increase in the resource gap, the difference between domestic savings and investment. As a percentage of GDP, the resource gap increased to 13.4 per cent in 2008 from 10.4 per cent in 2007.\n\nDomestic savings recorded a drop of 0.9 per cent compared to the growth of 26.1 per cent in 2007. The deceleration in domestic savings could be attributed to the continued deterioration of net external demand with increased growth in imports and the slowdown in export earnings during 2008. The estimated value of domestic savings was at Rs. 623 billion or 14.1 per cent of GDP in 2008, a decline from 17.6 per cent in the previous year. Of the total domestic savings, government dis-savings deteriorated by Rs. 88 billion while private sector savings grew by 3.6 per cent to Rs. 712 billion in 2008."

The continuous budgetary support for infrastructure development, despite \ufb01 scal constraints, is laudable, while more efforts to catalyse greater private \ufb01 nancing through Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are needed to supplement government investments and for a sustained development of infrastructure. Consistent policy, good governance and transparency, institutional capacity building, effective regulations and ef\ufb01 cient \ufb01 nancial markets are pre-requisites in promoting private investments in both economic and social infrastructure projects.\n\nThe government\u2019s policy on infrastructure development is designed with a view to developing a regionally balanced economy, addressing the economic and social disparity in the urban and rural areas. With the liberation of the Eastern and the Northern provinces, the country faces a huge challenge of developing basic infrastructure facilities as fast as possible for the people in those areas to start their original livelihood and to recoup the development in other areas and to fuel economic activities. In respect of the Eastern province, the government has already prepared a three-year comprehensive development plan, the \u2018Nagenahira Navodaya\u2019 (Eastern Revival), which is now being implemented with a total investment expenditure of Rs. 200 billion.

Further, under the provision of the Act, the CEB will continue to function as a vertically integrated utility with powers to hold generation, transmission and distribution licences simultaneously.\n\nPetroleum"

A hedging transaction is a sub-product in the wider market for derivative products which have been developed and offered on the basis of an available \ufb01 nancial product to generate liquidity, mitigate risks and raise the depth of the market.\n\nA long established legal principle relating to business deals has been the \u2018caveat emptor\u2019 or \u2018let the buyer beware\u2019. This principle simply enunciates that buyers of a transaction should take the requisite measures to protect themselves and the sellers have no responsibility for the losses incurred by buyers. When applied to a hedging product, it means that the buyer should learn of the risks involved and enter into the transaction with full knowledge. The principle holds even if the sellers have deliberately and intentionally misled the buyers into accepting a product that would bring them potential losses. However, the application of this legal principle for the derivative transactions has been withheld by courts in the wake of a plethora of cases in which the buyers in derivative transactions had incurred substantial losses persistently. That was after the issuers of hedging products, mainly investment banks, were accused of \u2018mis-selling\u2019 or \u2018mis-labelling\u2019 of products to the detriment of the buyers."

To cater to this requirement, it is important to improve the facilities and quality of the public transportation. An ef\ufb01 cient mass transport system can reduce the traf\ufb01 c congestion on main roads and thereby saving time and expenditure on petroleum imports.\n\nRoad Passenger Transportation\n\nThe road passenger transportation showed some improvement in 2008. The average number of buses operated per day by the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) increased by 2.9 per cent to 4,247, while the average number of buses operated by the private sector increased by 6.8 per cent to 12,929 in 2008. The total operated kilometres and passenger kilometres of SLTB increased by 2.5 per cent and 2.3 per cent, respectively, during the year. The total operated kilometres and passenger kilometres by private bus operators increased by 6.8 per cent. However, in 2008 new registration of passenger buses has decreased substantially by 55.3 per cent."

Passenger transportation and goods transportation decreased by 2.1 per cent and 9.4 per cent, respectively, in 2008 mainly due to cancellation of train operations between several areas due to security reasons and curtailment of unproductive train operations as well as increase in railway fares and freight charges. At present, the Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) contributes only around 5 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively, to the passenger transportation and goods transportation in the country. Though, the railway network of Sri Lanka consists of 1,640 kilometres, it operates only 1,200 kilometres due to the closure of several sections in the North and the East. However, with the liberation of the North and the East and reconstruction of the destroyed rail track, the SLR will be able to start railway operations to those areas."

The Towns North of Colombo Water Supply Project Stage II, the Greater Colombo Water Rehabilitation Project, the Towns South of Kandy Water Supply Project, the Rehabilitation and Augmentation of Kirindi Oya Water Supply Project, the Greater Galle Water Supply Project Stage II, the Nuwara Eliya District Group Water Supply Project, the Greater Kandy Water Supply Project Phase I Stage II and a few other projects were at various stages of implementation in 2008. Initiatives have been taken in 2008 to implement the Kalu Ganga Water Supply Project Phase I Stage II, the Augmentation of Negombo\n\nWater Supply Project, the Kelani Right Bank Water Treatment Plant and the Eastern Coastal Town of Ampara District Water Supply Project Phase III.\n\nWater supply sector has shown some improvement in 2008. As at present, around 78 per cent of the population has access to safe drinking water, of which 35 per cent had access to pipe borne water which is comparatively high compared to other neighbouring countries. NWS&DB has provided 108,039 new connections during the year which has resulted in 1.2 million connections including Industrial and commercial establishments by end 2008. The capital expenditure incurred by the NWS&DB has increased by 16.9 per cent in 2008. The \ufb01 nancial performance of the NWS&DB has however, weakened in 2008 as a result of operational loss of Rs.1.7 billion. In this regard, it is expected that the \ufb01 nancial position of the NWS&DB will improve in 2009 due to the tariff revision in February, 2009."

    "chunk_text": "Water supply sector has shown some improvement in 2008. As at present, around 78 per cent of the population has access to safe drinking water, of which 35 per cent had access to pipe borne water which is comparatively high compared to other neighbouring countries. NWS&DB has provided 108,039 new connections during the year which has resulted in 1.2 million connections including Industrial and commercial establishments by end 2008. The capital expenditure incurred by the NWS&DB has increased by 16.9 per cent in 2008. The \ufb01 nancial performance of the NWS&DB has however, weakened in 2008 as a result of operational loss of Rs.1.7 billion. In this regard, it is expected that the \ufb01 nancial position of the NWS&DB will improve in 2009 due to the tariff revision in February, 2009.\n\nThe water sector faces a few challenges in meeting its target of providing water to all in the medium-term. The provision of water supply in the Northern and the Eastern provinces would require additional effort and \ufb01 nancial resources, though the Government has already initiated several programmes to provide water supply in the Eastern province. Measures should be taken to improve an uninterrupted water supply in the midst of rising demand to areas,\n\nTable 3.7Water Supply by National Water Supply & Drainage Board\n\nGrowth Rate (%)Item\n\nTotal number of water supply schemes (b) 308 309 5.8 0.3Total number of new connections given during the period 89,313 108,039 9.2 21.0Total number of connections (b) 1,078,892 1,186,931 9.0 10.0Total water production (Mn.

Sri Lanka Demographic and Health Survey (2006-2007) highlights that 18 per cent of Sri Lankan children are stunted (below the level of height for age), 15 per cent of children are wasted (below the level of weight for height), 22 per cent of children are underweight (below the level of weight for age) and 4 per cent classi\ufb01 ed as severely underweight. The need to address malnutrition has been recognised by the Sri Lankan government. A recent Food and Nutrition Policy for 2004-10 emphasised the need for focusing on the poor and integrating nutrition with other sectoral activities, including health, agriculture, education, economic reform and rural development. Health authorities continued provisioning of vitamin supplements in clinics and also continued to provide nutrition education through their clinical network\n\nto address the micronutrient deficiency which is basically iron and Vitamin A in Sri Lanka. Although, the government is developing a new action plan, a coherent framework is still not in place to address malnutrition in Sri Lanka."

Although there are many social safety-nets and subsidy programmes in place, poverty eradication needs to be accelerated even further. Along with the increase of the number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) due to the conflict and Tsunami, a considerable number of people lost their sources of income. This has led to an increase in the poverty headcount ratios in the affected areas of the Northern and Eastern provinces.

There is a widespread network of Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Care Clinics, as well as services of trained Public Health Midwives.

These price revisions directly and indirectly affected the prices of both domestically produced and imported goods. The changes of the prices of kerosene, diesel and petrol were made administratively. In line with these fuel price revisions, both the public and private sector bus fares were also revised during 2008. The net impact of such changes resulted in an average increase of 17.6 per cent in bus fares during the year. Meanwhile, the rail fares were increased by an average rate of 79 per cent in June, 2008 for the \ufb01 rst time in three years. However, following the reduction in diesel prices in December, rail fares were decreased by 74 per cent. The electricity charges for both domestic and industrial purposes were increased in 2008, raising the cost of production of goods and services, thereby escalating price levels. Although the administrative price revisions had a spillover effect through increased input costs, the reduction of subsidy components embedded in those prices was an essential demand management measure to contain in\ufb02 ation in the long run.\n\nThe overall impact on in\ufb02 ation due to exchange rate variation was minimal during 2008 as the Sri Lanka Rupee was stable against the US dollar during the \ufb01 rst eight months of the year despite its marginal depreciation of 3.9 per cent on a year-on-year basis as at end 2008.

The cyclical factors are those that may ease over the years and hence, represent a short-term phenomenon. But, the structural factors arisen from growing gaps\n\nbetween the demand and the supply, will continue to threaten the globe from medium to long-run.\n\nThe cyclical factors included, (i) the random adverse weather conditions that affected harvests in key producing countries, \ufb02 ooding, pest infestation and cold weather in some countries, (ii) speculative demand before mid 2008 with funds \ufb02 owing into the commodity markets due to mortgage market turmoil in USA, (iii) the steep depreciation of the US dollar against all major currencies, particularly in 2007 which resulted in the increase of the prices in US dollar denominated commodities, (iv) precautionary demand for food stocks in many countries, and (v) policy responses in the form of export bans and price controls etc. by key rice exporting countries to counter domestic in\ufb02 ation, which increased the price volatility and uncertainty in the international food market."

The government could also supplement this momentum by popularising good agricultural practices and also availing credit facilities for producers in these areas in addition to its concerted effort aiming at improving infrastructure conducive for agriculture. In fact, the government\u2019s Ten Year Horizon Development Framework: 2006-2016 has already highlighted many of these areas to be followed for the development of the agriculture sector in the medium term. Sri Lanka, being an agrarian society at its large rural base and endowed with much natural resources is well in a position to enhance food production as its strategic response to high food prices.

It measures the overall movements of prices at producer level, of a wide range of goods covering consumer, intermediate and investment as well as those imported and those produced for export and for domestic uses. WPI on a point-to-point basis continued to increase on an acceleratedpath registering a peak of 42.1 per cent in May, 2008\n\nand started decelerating to 0.7 per cent in December, 2008. The annual average change of WPI was 24.9 per cent in December, 2008 as against the 24.4 per cent in December, 2007. The increased prices of crude oil and food prices in the international market were the main reasons for the year-on-year increase in WPI in the early part of 2008."

However, those in the sub-categories of rubber, coconut and paddy (male employees) enjoyed an increase in their real wages. Daily wages for carpentry and masonry in the Construction sector recorded an increase of around 16 per cent due to the wage demands made by these workers, the continued demand for workers for construction activities and also the shortages of such skilled workers due to migration for foreign employment. However, these employees experienced real wage losses in 2008, as in the last year.\n\nTable 4.7 District-wise Population\n\nSource: Registrar General\u2019s Department\n\n\u2018000 Persons\n\nColombo 2,456 2,488 32 1.3Kandy 1,380 1,396 16 1.2Ratnapura 1,086 1,099 13 1.2Badulla 850 861 11 1.3Kurunegala 1,524 1,535 11 0.7Gampaha 2,140 2,152 12 0.6Galle 1,052 1,063 11 1.0Anuradhapura 801 809 8 1.0Kalutara 1,111 1,118 7 0.6Matara 813 822 9 1.1Nuwara Eliya 742 749 7 0.9Ampara 615 624 9 1.5Batticaloa 523 530 7 1.3Puttalam 752 760 8 1.1Jaffna 599 603 4 0.7Matale 477 483 6 1.3Trincomalee 355 361 6 1.7Hambantota 552 558 6 1.1Moneragala 425 430 5 1.2Polonnnaruwa 395 400 5 1.3Mulaitivu 147 150 3 2.0Kilinochchi 146 150 4 2.7Vavuniya 166 167 1 0.6Kegalle 802 807 5 0.6Mannar 101 102 1 1.0Total 20,010 20,217 207 1.0\n\nDistrict2008(a)Change(a)Percentage Change(a)\n\n(a) Provisional\n\n2007\n\n4.4 Population, Labour Force and Employment\n\nPopulation"

However, for detailed comparison, the labour force data excluding Northern and Eastern provinces was used in the analysis, if stated otherwise.\n\nEmployment\n\nThe QLFS conducted by the DCS de\ufb01 nes an employed person as one who engaged in some kind of work for pay, pro\ufb01 t or family gain (unpaid) during the survey period. According to the status of the employment, persons who worked as paid employees, employers, own account workers (self-\n\nemployed), or unpaid family workers during the survey period were considered as employed persons in the QLFS. This includes persons with a job but not at work during the survey period. Employees temporarily absent from work due to illness, bad weather or labour disputes are also considered as employed.\n\nAccording to the QLFS, the number of employed persons increased by 1.9 per cent to 7.2 million in 2008 as compared to 7.0 million in the year 2007. This increase was partly due to the enhancement of employment opportunities on account of the full implementation of new development projects of the economy.\n\nThe composition of employed population, among the major industry groups recorded a slight change in 2008, increasing the share of the Agriculture sector from 31.3 per cent in 2007 to 32.7 per cent in 2008. Meanwhile, the shares of the Industry and Services sectors declined from 26.6 per cent to 26.3 per cent and from 42.1 per cent to 41.0\n\nTable 4.8Household Population, Labour Force and Labour Force Participation (a)\n\nItem2008"

In 2008, foreign employment placements reported an increase of 15.4 per cent compared to 8.2 per cent in 2007. According to the estimates of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE), the total number of departures for foreign employment was 252,021 during 2008 compared with 218,459 during the last year. The increase in overseas employment was observed in all categories of manpower namely, housemaids, skilled and unskilled labourers. The continued efforts to streamline procedures and prepare job aspirants to suit labour market requirements\n\nabroad has improved opportunities in the overseas job market during the year. Being a major source of foreign exchange earnings of the country, the total foreign remittances received during the year 2008 amounted to US Dollars 2,918 million, an increase of 16.6 per cent, compared to US Dollars 2,502 million received during 2007. This increase was mainly attributed to the awareness campaign launched by the SLBFE with the assistance of banks, licensed recruitment agencies and media in order to increase the level of foreign remittances from migrant workers."

Labour productivity, measured as the GDP per worker (at constant prices of 2002), increased by around 4 per cent in 2008 over the previous year, to Rs. 329,700 per worker. It is also noteworthy that the productivity has increased continuously over the last few years, rising from Rs. 286,000 per worker in 2005 to the current level, recording an average\n\nincrease of around 5 per cent per year.\n\nThe considerable increase in productivity in the Industrial and Services sectors was the main contributor to the increase in productivity in 2008, while the contribution from the Agriculture sector was marginal. The Industrial and Services sectors recorded increases of 5.1 per cent and 6.5 per cent, respectively in productivity while the Agriculture sector recorded an increase of 1.2 per cent during 2008.\n\nThe improvement of productivity is imperative for sustainable development as well as for maintaining price stability.

The economic fundamentals of the country, including external sector variables, had been improving steadily until the end of the third quarter of 2008. Most of the external sector indicators; exports, worker remittances, balance of payments, short-term investments and external reserves, performed well above the original projections. Exports were growing at around 10 per cent until September 2008, despite many challenges such as the economic slowdown of major trading partners, the rising oil prices and costs of production, the relatively stable exchange rate, the higher interest rates and the uncertainty about renewal of concessions under the GSP+ scheme. The import expenditure grew sharply on account of the unprecedentedly higher petroleum and commodity prices in the international markets and consequently, the trade de\ufb01 cit widened by 88.1 per cent by end September, 2008. The widened trade de\ufb01 cit was partly offset by the increased private remittances, which grew well above 20 per cent throughout the \ufb01 rst nine months, thereby softening the impact of the wider trade de\ufb01 cit on the current account. Net foreign short-term in\ufb02 ows to the government and the private sector peaked at US dollars 1,004 million by end September, 2008 and helped generate a surplus in the capital and financial account.\n\nEXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES\n\n104\n\nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2008\n\nEXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES\n\n5\n\nThis was more than suf\ufb01 cient to \ufb01 nance the higher current account de\ufb01 cit, generating a surplus of US dollars 173 million in the BOP by end September 2008."

The exchange rate appreciated during the first four months and depreciated thereafter, the volatility, however, was contained by the Central Bank\u2019s intervention in the domestic foreign exchange market. The capital account liberalisation was further promoted by permitting foreign investors to subscribe up to 10 per cent of the outstanding rupee denominated Treasury bills effective from May, 2008.

With this completion of the commitment, ISLFTA which came into effect from March, 2000 is now fully in force. Exports to India declined in 2008 mainly due to lower exports of copper, aluminium and related products. However, this does not undermine the vast potential in trade between the two countries, particularly at times when other major markets are affected by crisis.\n\nThe two nations are forging ahead with the negotiations for further liberalisation under the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). The CEPA is expected to take the ISLFTA one stride further, towards the greater economic integration between the two countries by reducing the respective negative lists further and incorporating trade in services. Although, both countries concluded the discussions on the CEPA Framework Agreement, the \ufb01 nalisation process was delayed in view of the stressing need for further consultations with all stakeholders to accommodate their views."

The sharp increases in international commodity prices led imports to grow by 33.7 per cent during the \ufb01 rst three quarters of 2008. Imports decelerated signi\ufb01 cantly thereafter with the changes in global economic conditions. The soaring commodity prices had an unfavourable impact on import expenditure until September 2008, when all major categories of imports grew very rapidly. Prices of most commodities, including petroleum, exhibited a series of historical highs during this period. The largest contribution to this growth came from intermediate goods, primarily due to the higher expenditures incurred on petroleum imports, whose share as a percentage of total imports had increased from 22 per cent in 2007 to 24 per cent in 2008. However, towards the end of year, the global economic crisis led to a substantial decline in global demand for petroleum and other commodities, which caused prices to plummet. The unexpected decline in prices led to a signi\ufb01 cant decline in import expenditure in the last quarter.\n\nChart 5.4 Imports by Commodities\n\nIntermediate 45%\n\nInvestment12%\n\nConsumer 42%\n\nOther1%\n\nOtherIntermediate15%\n\nOther1%\n\nOther Petroleum2%\n\nTextiles3%\n\nCrude Oil23%\n\nPaper Products1%\n\nFertiliser1%\n\n1977\n\nCrude Oil10%\n\nIntermediate60%\n\nTextiles12%"

The resulting reduction in expenditure on petroleum and other imports led growth in imports to decelerate very rapidly, to record a \ufb02 at rate in the last quarter.\n\nImport expenditure incurred on intermediate goods increased by 28.0 per cent to US dollars 8,341 million, contributing about 67 per cent towards the import growth in 2008. Apart from petroleum, a noteworthy increase in expenditure on fertiliser imports was recorded in 2008, led by the higher prices that prevaliled in the international markets and the increased volumes generated by the fertiliser subsidy. Over 50 per cent of imported fertilisers comprised of Urea in 2008, which is used extensively by the paddy farmers in Sri Lanka. The favourable trends in agricultural prices have prompted farmers to cultivate marginal lands, adding pressure on the fertiliser requirement. Imports of textiles and clothing, of US dollars 1,702 million in 2008,\n\ndepicted a modest increase of 4.3 per cent over that of 2007, re\ufb02 ecting the slow growth of apparel exports."

Apart from petroleum, a noteworthy increase in expenditure on fertiliser imports was recorded in 2008, led by the higher prices that prevaliled in the international markets and the increased volumes generated by the fertiliser subsidy. Over 50 per cent of imported fertilisers comprised of Urea in 2008, which is used extensively by the paddy farmers in Sri Lanka. The favourable trends in agricultural prices have prompted farmers to cultivate marginal lands, adding pressure on the fertiliser requirement.

The overall trade de\ufb01 cit widened by 60.6 per cent to US dollars 5,871 million in 2008 from US dollars 3,656 million in 2007.\n\nTerms of Trade\n\nThe prices of exports grew by 6.1 per cent in 2008. The monthly average price of tea exported from Sri Lanka continued to rise and reached the highest ever recorded level of US dollars 4.28 per kilogram in September, 2008. However from end September, they took on a declining trend as the emergence of recession ended the price boom. The lower demand for Ceylon Tea emanated mainly from the income effects of the unexpected decline in oil prices on the major oil exporting countries, which are the main buyers of Ceylon Tea. Demand from the rest of the world was affected by the global recession, which aggravated the situation. The average price of tea exported from Sri Lanka fetched US dollars 3.98 per kilogram in 2008, compared to the average price of US dollars 3.29 per kilogram obtained in 2007. As with tea, natural rubber exports drew attractive prices during the \ufb01 rst eight months of 2008. The highest export price of US dollars 3.24 per kilogram was recorded in July 2008 after which it was on a declining trend. The average export price of rubber, stood at US dollars 2.57 per kilogram in 2008, compared to the average price of US dollars 2.12 per kilogram in 2007. This remarkable increase re\ufb02 ects increasing crude oil prices which raised the cost of producing synthetic rubber and the strong demand for tyre production, especially from China,\n\n\u2018 000 mt\n\nRice 222 52 12 88 84 1st Quarter 9 43 3 4 41 2nd Quarter 9 4 2 7 28 3rd Quarter 4 2 3 3 12 4th Quarter 200 3 4 74 3\n\nWheat 993 864 1,200 952 919 1st Quarter 257 272 287 204 272 2nd Quarter 218 191 321 388 312 3rd Quarter 189 174 331 274 153 4th Quarter 329 227 261 87 182"

The transshipment handling has recorded a growth of around 11.5 per cent during 2008. In order to sustain the growth in port-related activities and to successfully meet the future challenges from the competing ports in the region, Sri Lanka Ports Authority has improved its operations and has enhanced its productivity.\n\nTravel and Tourism\n\nThe tourism industry remained sluggish during 2008 and the cumulative tourist arrivals declined by 11.2 per cent to 438,475 in 2008 compared to 494,008 arrivals in 2007. At the beginning of the year, arrivals were mainly affected by the travel advisories issued by some major tourist generating countries and as the year progressed, these factors were combined with the global\n\nrecession that resulted from \ufb01 nancial market turmoil. Decreases in arrivals were recorded in respect of key markets of South Asia and Western Europe as well as other markets such as East Asia, North America and Australia during 2008. Increases in arrivals were recorded from the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Earnings from tourism declined to US dollars 342 million in 2008 from US dollars 385 million in 2007. In terms of purpose of visit, of the 438,475 tourist arrivals in 2008, majority of them (73.2 per cent) visited the country for holiday purposes, while 8.5 per cent came for business purposes. While 8.3 per cent indicated they were visiting friends and relatives, 2.6 per cent visited for religious and cultural purposes, and 1.3 per cent had come for conventions and meetings."

As part of further liberalisation of the capital account, the government permitted foreigners to invest up to a maximum of 10 per cent of the value of outstanding Treasury bills effective from May 2008. As a result of the liberalisation of Treasury bills market, government received a net in\ufb02 ow of US dollars 51 million on account of Treasury bills during 2008.
